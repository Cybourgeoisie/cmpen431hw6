Quang Nguyen, Ben Heidorn
Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
yup

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
thanks! I'll talk to you soon.

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
best of luck then man!

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
dang... that's brutal.

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
pretty short notice

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
but I have until next week to make the decision, lol

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
I'm not sure yet

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
oh that sucks... is there a posibility that you have to move with her?

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
we both received invitations to join her, so it's kind of been a nerve-wracking week

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
I got news from my advisor that I was expecting for about a week now (she's moving to another university), so I have plans to discuss that with the post doc in the group tonight

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
we can meet up tomorrow, most likely

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
2 finals... you lucky dog. Alright. I'm gonna try update the spreadsheet to the best of my ability and we can meet up later tonight or whenever you are free

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
I can handle a lot of the paper

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
I have some research stuff that has to be done by friday morning, but besides that

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
I only have two finals and this project

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
don't worry too much about it

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
dang... I have so much due on monday...

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:20pm EST
when is this project due again? Monday?

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:20pm EST
Alright and you are probably gonna need to reorder the spreadsheet alittle bit since I don't have a good understanding of the order in which they were ran

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:19pm EST
where needed

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:19pm EST
I'll also revisit the spreadsheet and update it

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:19pm EST
then we can meet up again later tonight or tomorrow to discuss the final hurrah

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:19pm EST
now that I can look over the results from the older ifqsize test and all, I'm going to investigate it further

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:18pm EST
that's my impression

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:18pm EST
just a thought

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:18pm EST
The findings of the tests later in the list would invalidate all the findings earlier in the list since they were done with more optimized test cases?

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
yea. So I updated the spreadsheet to include all the test cases are that are currently in the ./scripts/ folder. And I also tried to reorganized it in the order in which the tests were executed. If we update or findings in their and make sure the order of the tests are correct, then writing the paper would be as simple as just going down the list and putting it into words

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 3:15pm EST
hey dude - I'm at a computer if you're free for a few minutes

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:50pm EST
ok

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:49pm EST
I'm on foot now, but I will be on a computer shortly so we can recap.

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:49pm EST
They're listed usually as comments in the follow up scripts or are listed / derived from the notes in the research folder.

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:45pm EST
or do you just have it in your head?

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:43pm EST
Have you been recording you findings for the last couple of tests that you ran?

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:39pm EST
Yeah, the numbers are really high, so I'm curious to validate that our latest numbers will beat those.

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:38pm EST
or 3.4 in the int case

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:37pm EST
I didn't realized that we were hitting closer to 3.0 with that simple test

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:37pm EST
for the ifqsize, we agreed that it should not be 1 or 2. That was the only conclusion that we made about it

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:35pm EST
There was one thing - you had some tests earlier about the ifq size and fetch speed and all. It looked like you hit really high GMs, which is something I'm curious to review. Beyond that, I think we're nearly done with testing.

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:34pm EST
Oh, sweet, that just about wraps up our tests. I committed a ton of stuff earlier this morning. The results for dyn4_* and dyn8_* are particularly interesting, as they're the highest GMs I've seen. I think we have enough to probably make one final test with all we know, and use the top values from that test.

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:24pm EST
It supports your earlier findings that the ras should be 8 or 16. The changes between 2/4 ways for the BTB was like +-0.0005

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:22pm EST
Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:22pm EST
Here are my findings from the RAS and BTB test

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 12:05am EST
Haha it's all good. You did all the hard stuff so I can't complain.

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 12:02am EST
I remember now that you asked me, but it slipped my mind pretty quickly

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 12:01am EST
sorry for dropping the ball on the BTB last night

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 9, 2015 at 12:01am EST
sounds good, man. thanks again

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:59pm EST
The RAS_BTB i mean

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:58pm EST
That sounds good. I just ran the other test. Now I have to get out of the library before the buses stop coming around

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:57pm EST
gonna review it and either call it a night or set up one more, then call it a night

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:57pm EST
just got the results for that other test

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:56pm EST
yea this is definitely not standard

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:53pm EST
and we're abusing github to no end, lol

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:52pm EST
normally, I'd say we should keep binaries / data out of the repo, but this isn't a standard code repository

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:52pm EST
lol, yeah..

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:51pm EST
and we have been zipping our results too... imagine if we didn't zip it all up. I would not want to clone this repo at this point

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:50pm EST
that's insane, lol

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:49pm EST
oh man, seriously?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:48pm EST
lol the size of our project file is almost half a GB... that's crazy!

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:42pm EST
I know one or 2 groups that are using ssh but I don't think they are using at the extent that we are. In fact, it's pretty safe to say that no one is using it at the extent that we are. haha

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:40pm EST
I wonder if anyone else has been doing their work over ssh for this class

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:39pm EST
lol, I've avoided it like the plague

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:39pm EST
Have you seen how busy the lab is lately? That place is packed!!

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:39pm EST
looks like the network just slowed to a crawl there

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:37pm EST
or someone just overloaded all of the computers in the lab

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:37pm EST
either IST internet connection is really bad right now

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:37pm EST
lol, thanks. glad that my skills come in handy for this project

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:34pm EST
lol I'm still amazed that the speed at which you are cranking these out. You got the system down pat

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:33pm EST
it was

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:33pm EST
dynamic 8 falling behind pretty badly before right?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:33pm EST
I'm assuming that the floating point ALU / Mult is more or less whatever (set to static values), and I'm trying the remaining combinations of integer values for dyn-4 and dyn-8 - should get results within the hour

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:32pm EST
but this is pretty great

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:32pm EST
I know! I'm surprised, tbh

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:31pm EST
So that means we are pretty set on dynamic 4 and 8 for both of int and float now. sweet!

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:29pm EST
oh gotcha

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:28pm EST
4 and 8

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:28pm EST
what is dynamic 48?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:27pm EST
and 2.9 for dyn-4

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:27pm EST
dynamic got as far as 3.1 for dyn-4

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:27pm EST
yep

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:26pm EST
that's a big difference

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:26pm EST
oh wow, static didn't even get over 1.6 and dynamic got up to 2.4

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:22pm EST
breaking bad sets the bar for excellence in storytelling

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:22pm EST
oh, definitely

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:21pm EST
maybe the tv show is better than the book. I gotta watching breaking bad before I watch GoT through

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:21pm EST
I listened to half of the audiobook and stopped because it just seems like it was just a drama book + dragons

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:20pm EST
pushed, btw

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:20pm EST
yeah, I was hesitant about it for a long time, but it's really enjoyable

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:20pm EST
do you like it?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:19pm EST
also I've been watching game of thrones for the first time

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:19pm EST
...

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:19pm EST
I enjoy using elaborate phrases

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:19pm EST
lol

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:18pm EST
lol this isn't a drama show ben

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:14pm EST
because I think this is the death knell for the static issues

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:14pm EST
I'll commit these graphs in particular

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:14pm EST
I just got results back on various ALUs and Mults

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:14pm EST
a hundred tests or two doesn't take too long to run

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:13pm EST
If you'd like

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:13pm EST
so how should we create the test for the BTB? Should we try every combination of the RAS again with it since it might make a difference?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:10pm EST
I guess its not the same on windows cuz it didn't work. I'll google it then

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:08pm EST
at least it is on a mac

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:08pm EST
otherwise, it might just be clicking while holding down the alt key

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:08pm EST
if I remember correctly

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:08pm EST
you can middle click and select multiple cursors

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:07pm EST
if you have a mouse

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:07pm EST
clever!

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:07pm EST
actually

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:07pm EST
oh you used that feature that I can never remember the keys for

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:07pm EST
a lot of the different values had the same number of characters, so a text editor sufficed

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:07pm EST
so it wasn't painful

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
the filenames are really standard, so I set multiple cursors and then edited one line, which edited 10 lines at a time

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
no way

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
oh wow... that's pretty significant

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
lol, sublime text

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
how did you pull all the caches data apart? regex?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
the GMs jumped by 0.5

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:06pm EST
much

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:05pm EST
oh really? so you are seeing better spikes?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:04pm EST
and now I'm just back to testing the different combinations of hardware, which is having much more of an effect now

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
once I got those values, I came up with the caches I sent you

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
topAfterOptimizingCache

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
in the research folder

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
git pull

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
one moment

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
I committed something with a lot of raw data of the top matches..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:03pm EST
I think I've been pretty bad at communicating the changes, but I didn't want to inundate you with a bunch of incomplete thoughts

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:02pm EST
For you everything is getting blurry. For me, I'm getting lost for what needs to be done since I have been slacking haha

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:01pm EST
I'm just not sure if we need to optimize the test or not

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 11:01pm EST
haha. Alright. do you want me just extend the RAS test to include the btb then?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:59pm EST
not going to lie, this work on this project is starting to blur into one continuous memory

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:58pm EST
caches, I think

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:58pm EST
I already forget what I tested last night

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:58pm EST
I tested the RAS.. I can handle that a bit later if you want

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:57pm EST
I thought last night we split up the work load. I covered the tlb and you covered the bpred:ras and bpred:btb

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:56pm EST
with different caches

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:56pm EST
I know we tested the different branch predictors

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:56pm EST
did we? I forget

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:56pm EST
did we not do a btb test??

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:56pm EST
it's an funny and informative video series

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:55pm EST
also, that's awesome, I'll check out the video soon!

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:55pm EST
we're not sure what is optimal for those

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:54pm EST
the BTB values

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:54pm EST
one thing does come to mind though

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:54pm EST
haha, it's totally cool, I'm just doing little things here and there right now

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:53pm EST
Lol I feel like I am letting you do all the work.... is there a part that you want me to tackle?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:51pm EST
I don't know much about machine learning at all so these videos blow my mind away

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:51pm EST
I was watching this video series last night and you comment about the big jump reminded be of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFws_hhZs8

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:50pm EST
a restricted range, but one that should give us enough info to work with

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:50pm EST
so I'm testing 4-wide and 8-wide as well as static once more

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:50pm EST
once the ALU went up, and the other hardware components were increased

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
I saw a big jump in the GM, btw

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
that's what I'm thinking

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
2 * issue:width ... that still leaves us with a lot of combinations. We can just pick 2 or 3 best one and run with it so that we don't blow up the size of our test

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:47pm EST
everything else is still fuzzy or interchangeable

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:47pm EST
no question

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:47pm EST
we want at least 2 integer ALUs

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:47pm EST
without a doubt

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:46pm EST
I just ran one on all of the permutations of FPalu/mult/Ialu/mult/memport for dynamic 2-wide

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:46pm EST
what tests are you running now?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:45pm EST
yea i remember you saying that

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:45pm EST
note that the IL1 value is duplicated for DL1 in make_config.py

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
*wide

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
but those are very high quality caches, if not the best we'll see, for dynamic 2-wise

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
the latter IL1 and UL2 are just to make my follow-up tests simpler

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
# int, followed by fp: il1 = ["il1:256:64:2:l", "il1:512:64:1:l"] il1 = ["il1:256:64:2:l"] # same for int & fp: ul2 = ["ul2:2048:128:4:l", "ul2:4096:128:2:l"] # winner by a hair for both int and fp ul2 = ["ul2:4096:128:2:l"]

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
after that test, I found that the best cache values seem to be about...

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:43pm EST
I saw from the git pull that you set up some other tests. Anything special from the other cache test?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
there was where the disconnect was

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
nah, then we'd look for a smaller value

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
i thought we were take cur exe / baseline exe time

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
oh got it

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
[IC x clock_cycle_time_base]/IPC_base) / [IC x clock_cycle_time_test]/IPC_test)

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:41pm EST
you can work it out really quickly if you divide the execution times

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:41pm EST
sure

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:41pm EST
yea I'm gonna need to take a minute or two to internalize what you just said yet

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:40pm EST
but yeah, the larger the geometric mean, the better the set

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:40pm EST
haha, sorry, I just wanted to walk through the steps to make sure my thought process was correct

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:40pm EST
Oh alright. someone brought it up and it scared the crap out of me '

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:39pm EST
because the GM is proportional to the ratio, which depends on a larger IPC for our test set

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:39pm EST
so as our IPC increases, so does the GM

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:39pm EST
we want our cur_IPC to be larger than the base_IPC

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:39pm EST
cur_IPC / base_IPC

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:39pm EST
we arrive at:

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:39pm EST
base exec time / current exec time, after we eliminate the instruction count (and for simplicity, let's say that the clock cycles are equal)

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:38pm EST
if we just look at the ratio..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:38pm EST
GM is a root of the product of all of the ratios of the standard execution times over our current execution times

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:37pm EST
and the unit for the execution time is in ps

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:37pm EST
so therefore it is the inverse of IPC

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:36pm EST
[IC x clock_cycle_time]/IPC)

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:36pm EST
why is the execution time divided by the IPC?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:01pm EST
the execution time is divided by the ipc therefore it should decrease as the machine gets better

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 9:59pm EST
Hey, someone brought up a point that shouldn't we look for a lower geometric means?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:50pm EST
Let's hope so.

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:48pm EST
Haha, yeah, it's a lot of material, but I suspect that the length of the test will be similar and the depth of the material won't be as great. Just a guess, though.

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
Oh good god. That's a lot of stuff...

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:43pm EST
Sorry, I wasn't clear.

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:43pm EST
Lol, 40% of the material covered on the final is from before the midterm, and 60% is from the midterm to today.

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:42pm EST
Wait what?? I don't remember the final being worth that much in the syllabus...

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 5:34pm EST
We have to email the lab TAs apparently to get our lab grades. And there's no class on Thursday, since we finished the slides. Final is 40% everything before midterm, 60% after. He also made fun of our abilities to do math and said the math on the test should be remedial, lol.

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 4:16pm EST
Ok

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 4:16pm EST
Aight. Me neither. I'll ask at the end of class

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
Nope. I haven't heard a single thing from any of the TAs

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
Question.. did you get your grades for either lab in 514?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
hahaha thanks!

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
so if he says anything like that, I'll let you know

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
he was pretty pissed about how empty the room was, and in-between slides, he said "that slide is going to be on the midterm"

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
the class before the first 431 exam, I reluctantly attended, and the class was almost empty since so many people are also in 431 and decided to study

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
I want to skip, but he occasionally says something in-between breaths that's really critical

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
lol, thanks

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
thanks. Have fun in 514 lol

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
good luck!

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
yea

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
the algorithms homework?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
oh ok. I gotta skip 514 to continue to work on this homework... apparently it's harder than I though... The good news is that it is stumping everyone else too.

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
lol, so end of 514

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
unfortunately, beginning of 514

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
and I didn't know you can chain it up like that. Well, I guess we are just going to have to wait until these 2 tests are done. What's your estimate for how long it is going to take

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
haha, I had no idea about the feature until I saw you used it in the first set of cache tests

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:19pm EST
Holy crap! You are freaking cranking these out at a crazy pace. Oh and way to abuse the list comprehension feature. lol

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:18pm EST
I'm really glad we came up with the same results, more or less

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
lol, god I hope this works

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
which we should be able to do tonight

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:16pm EST
whatever emerges from this, we should use as the default to test the rest of the parameters, like ALU / Mult / TLB, then put it all together for the final push

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:16pm EST
that should be the last cache set, save the finale

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:16pm EST
I took those parameters, made two tests - one for all static, one for all dynamic, and I'm running them now

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:15pm EST
haha

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:15pm EST
I know!

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:14pm EST
This looks doable at this point haha

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:14pm EST
With the number of ways and block size being pretty defined, we can probably generate a reasonable number of sets

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:12pm EST
Hey that is looking good!!

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
that's L2

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
# ifqsize = [4,8,16] # nsets: # int: 2048, 4096 # fp: 4096, 8192 # blocks: # int: 128 # fp: 64, 128 # ways: # int: 2, 4 # fp: 2, (4)

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
anything in parentheses is "could be included, but probably not"

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:02pm EST
# ifqsize = [4,8] # nsets: # int: 256, 512, (1024) # fp: 512, 1024, 2048 # blocks: # int: 32, 64 # fp: 32, 64 # ways: # int: (1,) 2 # fp: 1

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:02pm EST
L1:

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:02pm EST
I have the most comprehensive findings for the cache yet, and it's narrowed down enough that we could probably go with it

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:02pm EST
alright

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:10pm EST
sounds good

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:09pm EST
Oh ok. Let me know when you get the result for your cache check. We can make some tests after that then

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:08pm EST
pretty much the same as what we've been doing

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:08pm EST
eliminate all of the parameters that are unlikely to produce a top design

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:07pm EST
what do you mean by limit the caches to their bare essentials?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:06pm EST
then top it off with a final set with all of the "most likely" parameters

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:06pm EST
and then I guess we can start testing combinations of the other parameters, get those down to the most performant values..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:06pm EST
then we should limit the caches to their bare essentials

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:05pm EST
should be done in about an hour

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:05pm EST
I'm running one sanity check on the cache

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:05pm EST
I think we're coming really close to that

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:03pm EST
or we can break the static and dynamic into their issue:width also

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:02pm EST
What do you think we should do at this point. make 2 massive tests, one for static and one for static and run it?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:01pm EST
it's dense

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:01pm EST
haha, yeah

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 2:01pm EST
That makes my head hurts haha

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:59pm EST
http://bruxy.regnet.cz/linux/bash_cheatsheet/bash_cheatsheet.pdf

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:59pm EST
btw, I found this crazy bash cheat sheet

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:53pm EST
that looks right to me

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:51pm EST
Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:51pm EST
This is putting your findings in a concise format. Also, I combined it with what I found also. Let me know if you think it is relevant since your test consider other options that I didnt'

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:40pm EST
good finds

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:40pm EST
Again my findings are based on the ex_BT_comb_dynamic/static tests only

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:39pm EST
the # of ways for L1 differ depending if it is int or float

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:38pm EST
Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:38pm EST
Ok I made some modification to my findings in regard to L1

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:35pm EST
for float, ul2 does best with 4096 / 8192

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
okay

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
oh wow

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
for int

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
actually for L1, the 1/2/4 way differ by +- 0.0005

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
followed by the rest

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
8192 in a distant 3rd

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:34pm EST
ul2 - 2048, 4096 for number of sets is performing best

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:32pm EST
but I'm finding 2/4-way for L2

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:31pm EST
instead of 2/4-way

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:30pm EST
I'm actually finding 1/2-way for L1

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:30pm EST
oh gotcha

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:30pm EST
optimal_caches.py

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:29pm EST
Which test are you getting these results from cuz I thought all the BT tests have fixed block size

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
the middle one is cache block size

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
ul2:%s:%s:%s:l

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:27pm EST
wait how did you calculate cache block size?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:27pm EST
in all cases, though, assoc is low

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:27pm EST
I'm also finding that, for floating point, L1 can be direct mapped

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:26pm EST
awesome

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:26pm EST
almost exactly what I'm finding

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:26pm EST
that's like

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:25pm EST
Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:25pm EST
this looks better.

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:25pm EST
static int - 1,2,4: {L2 : [2 way, 232768 sets] , L1: [There is no conclusive pattern]} Static float - 1,2,4: {L2 : [2 way, 24096/22048 sets], L1: [2/4 way, No conclusive pattern for the # of sets]} Dynamic int - 2,4,8: {L2 : [2 way, 232768 sets], L1: [2/4 way, No conclusive pattern for the # of sets]} Dynamic float: - 2,4,8: {L2 : [2 way, 24096/22048 sets], L1: [2/4 way, No conclusive pattern for the # of sets]}

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:25pm EST
here are my finding for the comb cache tests

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:25pm EST
ul2 associativity - probably best at 2 or 4

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:23pm EST
128 or 64 are fairly equal for floating point

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:23pm EST
let me amend my statement - 128 for a cache size is far superior for integer tests

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
integer: ifqsize is 2, 4 or 8

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
but not 2

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
floating point: ifqsize is 4, 8 or 16

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
32 barely makes a scratch

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
*superior

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
128 is far superioir

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
ul2 - cache block size of 64 or 128

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
these are my findings:

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
just ran a number of cache tests

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 12:34pm EST
oh nvm. that's because I did a commit before I do the git stash and git pull

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 12:33pm EST
I'm so confused.... the resulting graph folders aren't showing up on my git stage. It is there in my directory but I can't seem to be able to add it to my stage...

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 9:59am EST
our systems are beating the homework GMs, which is a nice sanity check

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 9:58am EST
also, for good measure, I re-ran the homework sets through the process to see how they fare

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 9:58am EST
awesome, thanks - I'll update what I've got there

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:10am EST
I marked the one that I ran on the google spreadsheet if you want a ref

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 8, 2015 at 1:09am EST
Ben so I just checked the on the lab computers and apparently I ran out disk space so all the test cases were killed. So I removed all the files and start "ex_BT_comb_dynamic" and " ex_BT_comb_static" again. Feel free to start the other 2/4 when you get up. Lets hope that these 2 experiments don't crash my disk space again

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
sounds good

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:48pm EST
Alright. I fixed the BT tests. I'm gonna run them and then get back to this hw

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
haha congrats

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
yeeeessss

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:44pm EST
screen's working

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:43pm EST
oh man

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:38pm EST
Alright. I might get to it tonight. I'll post something if I do

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:37pm EST
yup

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:37pm EST
*not

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:37pm EST
Oh this is the test it self now the make config script. gotcha

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:35pm EST
I didn't - the original tests are still written as direct mapped

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:35pm EST
ifqsize - definitely not 1, but could be 2 in some cases

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:35pm EST
You fixed the hard coded bug right?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:34pm EST
I'm okay with leaving it for later

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:34pm EST
your call

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:34pm EST
Oh I forgot, do you want to run all the BT tests again so we know whether or not L2 cache should be direct mapped?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:33pm EST
I think we need to amend that

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:33pm EST
I ran one more test, this time validating the assumption that ifqsize must be greater than 2

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 10:33pm EST
okay, final musings for the night

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:54pm EST
or, sometimes, if you show up late

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:53pm EST
I only show up because he more or less penalizes everyone if not enough people show up

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:53pm EST
haha, yeah.. he's kind of a dick

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:51pm EST
unfortunately, the teacher doesn't give a crap about the students so I don't give a crap about the class....

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:51pm EST
The weird thing is that 514 would be one of my most interesting classes if we just consider about how much I have been enjoying the material

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:50pm EST
but you'll be fine though.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:50pm EST
and yeah, 514 is not the most interesting class either

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:50pm EST
ok... I lied. Its moderately hard for me. I don't have a strong math background so I was struggling in the beginning

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:50pm EST
haha, awesome

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:49pm EST
undergrad. It's part of the track that I have to take. It's isn't hard at all. The hard part is paying attention in class haha

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:47pm EST
undergrad or grad? I'm slated to take the undergrad one next semester, and that sounds terrifying, lol

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:46pm EST
yea

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:46pm EST
is that for algorithms?

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:46pm EST
so my hw for one of my class is proving the correctness of the Dijkstra's algorithm and I'm having a problem with it. That speaks to how much I have been learning in 514....

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:43pm EST
also, I learned a lot of python tricks in reading your code, which is great

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:43pm EST
thanks man. I appreciate it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:43pm EST
it's not, and I mean it, haha. you're a good developer, and you have a good instinct for what needs to be done

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:42pm EST
I hope that's a joke haha

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:41pm EST
haha, I agree - I'm glad you're learning a lot about coding skills! you're a solid coder, and honestly a lot better than most of the developers I've worked with at my previous job

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:40pm EST
but we can't celebrate yet. The project isn't done haha

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:39pm EST
I heard the word alot, but I'm starting to get the understand of why it is important

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:38pm EST
haha no not at all. Honestly, I'm learning a crap load about basic coding skills. I have been developing a better understanding of what you mean by my code was too tighly coupled

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:36pm EST
that said, I apologize if I'm driving you up a wall

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:36pm EST
I enjoy working with you - I don't think many other people would tolerate putting in this much effort, lol

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:36pm EST
I'm glad I asked you cuz I definitely wouldn't have gotten this far with someone else

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:36pm EST
which should be a breeze compared to the testing portion

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:35pm EST
yea I agree. We are pretty darn close to the end of our testing stage and onto the paper writing stage

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:34pm EST
so I'd say we're most of the way finished with our tests

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:33pm EST
plus we have a ton of material to write a paper

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:33pm EST
I think we're on the right track, so I'm confident that we can start taking it easy soon

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:33pm EST
I'm probably going to crash pretty soon

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:33pm EST
lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:33pm EST
this project has slowly devoured me from the inside

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:33pm EST
I'm a shell of a man, Quang

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:32pm EST
You're still going strong aren't you?? Committing new tests still. I admire your stamina lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:29pm EST
niiice

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:28pm EST
Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:28pm EST
yea so i guess it doesn't matter at all.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:18pm EST
probably means that the L1 cache and L2 cache will play a much larger role in the final system

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:17pm EST
and it makes sense, since the earlier test on the ifqsize, speed and L1 cache showed massive improvements based on how the L1 cache was designed

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:17pm EST
that's good to know

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:17pm EST
looks like the TLB only matters down to a factor of 10^-3

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:04pm EST
lol, it can wait if need be

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:04pm EST
only if you want

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:03pm EST
I guess that makes sense since it would affect all the machines equally. the tlb test just finished. I can analyze it now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
*bpred

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
fetch:speed, like bored:ras, has minimal impact on the final result

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:28pm EST
lol its all good

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:28pm EST
we just need to add this constraint to the validation. maximum ul2 block size is 128 B, must be at least double the dl1 block size

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:27pm EST
sorry to bother you

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:27pm EST
lol, if I missed it, I won't anymore

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:27pm EST
oh well

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:27pm EST
which doesn't really say that the block size has to be at least the size of the L1 block size

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:27pm EST
yeah.. the only thing I see is "Y >= size(cache:dl1)+size(cache:il1) && Y <= 128"

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:26pm EST
nope. I just checked. we must have missed it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:26pm EST
I don't think it was coded

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:25pm EST
wait... I thought we already added a constraint to make sure that y >= x

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:25pm EST
it could be some multiple of Y and another of the parameters, but I'm pretty sure it's just simply if X > Y

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:25pm EST
I'm not 100% that the above is true, but for everything I've tried so far, it is true

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:24pm EST
a lot of trial and error, lol

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:24pm EST
oh nice! how in the world did you figure that part out?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:22pm EST
if X is ever bigger than Y, simple scalar does not throw an error, but it just automatically fails every test

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:22pm EST

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 8:21pm EST
found out why some of our simple scalar tests were failing

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
alright good luck

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
good luck, man

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
will do

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
Oh no. definitely keep me posted.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
unless you want me not to, so you can get some peace about this, lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
I'll keep you posted on anything else I find

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
as long as you want, really

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
oh, yeah, feel free to take a break

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
oh gotcha

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
I'm not really concerned

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
also, it's programming languages

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
that's entirely my own fault

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
I haven't been able to go to class due to obsession, lol

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
Oh did you try the screen command again? I just realized why you said you weren't able to go to class

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:19pm EST
I'll report back once I get the result for the tlb stuff

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:19pm EST
Alright. Do you mind if I call it quit for a while? I have a homework assignment due on wednesday that I'm pretty stumped on.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:18pm EST
I might do that. I'm still thinking of any other quick tests to run to further narrow down our options

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:18pm EST
that's not a bad idea

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:18pm EST
*change

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:18pm EST
why don't you just chance the hard-coded part and run it now and grab the results tomorrow morning?

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
oh that's right. you said that

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
I want to rerun those with fewer other constraints to see how it fares

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
it turned out that the test I ran had it hard-coded to direct mapped

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
oh, I'm not confident about that anymore

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:16pm EST
also, l2 cache should be direct mapped

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:16pm EST
yup!

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
where applicable

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
and ifqsize > 2

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
at least, I'm going to make those changes

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
bpred = comb

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
RAS = 8, not permanent

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
so, to summarize..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
nah thats fine. we can start making those decisions once we see that our make_configs file generate too many configs

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
we are looking for two "best" designs, one for int and another for floating point. I don't know if they'll be two different issue widths, but they could be.. but it's not looking likely

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
unless you disagree

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
I'm thinking we should keep testing all of them until we've ruled out most of the possible opportunities for a certain issue width to pull through

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:13pm EST
but I'm still not certain that some other config won't completely change things up

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:13pm EST
I want to say that we should dump static issue 4-wide..

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:13pm EST
yea i know that kinda complicates things

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:13pm EST
it's gonna be impressive if issue width 8 wins

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:12pm EST
I'm kinda thinking that

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:12pm EST
yeah

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:12pm EST
well..

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:12pm EST
So basically, the final test should only consider issue:width of 2 or 4 for dynamic...

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:12pm EST
I'm still pretty disappointed about the lack of solidarity with the ALUs and Mults

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:12pm EST
these results are making me feel a lot better about this project

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:11pm EST
thanks

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:11pm EST
awesome

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:11pm EST
I logged the your findings in the excel file

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:11pm EST
because I don't think it will matter

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:11pm EST
yea, we can just have it set at 8 or 16 only

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:11pm EST
so for tests leading up to our final test, we can just set the RAS to 8 or whatever

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:10pm EST
and we can still mess with RAS, but the difference is down to 10^-3

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:10pm EST
only test comb

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:10pm EST
I'm suggesting that we..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:10pm EST
ex_baseline_optimal_bpred_ras produced the right-hand side

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:10pm EST
ex_baseline_optimal_bpred is the test that produced the results you see on the left-hand side of the image

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:09pm EST
ex_baseline_optimal is just the baseline test with changes made to optimize RUU / LSQ / memwidth

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:09pm EST
pretty handily

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:09pm EST
but from the left-hand side, you can see that comb dominates

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:09pm EST
the right is RAS = 8 or 16

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:09pm EST
on the left-hand side is RAS = 0

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
with Integer sorted

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
that's the screenshot, btw

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
I added a new parameter to makeConfigs

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
what is ex_baseline_optimal?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
of what I'm seeing

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
send you a snapshot

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
let me..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
I'm proposing we use comb

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
I just wanted to compare it once more

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
we already figured that out in one of our hw

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:05pm EST
Are you proposing that we use comb from now on then

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:04pm EST
not surprising, but a RAS of 0 is bad

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:04pm EST
haha thanks.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:03pm EST
very clever implementations, btw

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:03pm EST
your test looks good

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:02pm EST
I've got it down to a system, lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:02pm EST
yeah, I've been running these tests rapidfire

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:02pm EST
wait you already got the results?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:01pm EST
I'll check it over now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:01pm EST
comb pretty much has it in the bag

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:01pm EST
but even with either RAS, the 2lev and bimod are competing for second and third place

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:01pm EST
for some, 8 is better, for others, 16 is better

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 7:01pm EST
the RAS is mixed

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:56pm EST
ok. I wrote the test. It was pretty simple. take a look at it and let me know what you think

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:46pm EST
ok

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:46pm EST
I'm going to test the RAS

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:45pm EST
yup.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:44pm EST
the TLB should be standalone, so whatever you find from that, we can implement those optimizations

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:44pm EST
I think I'm getting good information

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:44pm EST
I'm running tests starting from the baseline and changing only those parameters that I'm confident about

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:43pm EST
git pull

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:43pm EST
sounds good to me

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:43pm EST
Does that sounds like a decent game plan?

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:43pm EST
Ok so for the tlb. We don't have latency parameters that are based on how large it is. So I'm just going to max it out and change the level of associativity of it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:18pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:16pm EST
alright. I'm gonna take a quick 20 minutes nap. When I get up, I'll tackle one of them.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:15pm EST
yeah, I think that's it

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:15pm EST
So... the only 3 things that we still need to test for are the tlb, bpred:ras and bpred:btb right?

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:06pm EST
and I don't think we will need to fix that bug another way. the graph function would take care of the problem since it sorts the results

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:05pm EST
I'm wondering if we found a bug with simple scalar.. not too surprising, but I wonder what's causing it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:05pm EST
it's a small step forward

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:04pm EST
alright. I agree with you that ifqsize of 1 and 2 doesn't do anything and the rest of the parameters doesn't affect the systems at all

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:02pm EST
likely not

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:02pm EST
lol

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:02pm EST
lol I don't think screamo is going to make you mood improve with this project

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:01pm EST
I've regressed to listening to screamo from the late 90s / early 2000s to cope with this project

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 6:01pm EST
alright

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:59pm EST
we'll fix it when we know what graphs we want to include in the paper

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:58pm EST
but you're right. that did do the trick

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:58pm EST
without that, our plot is going to look really weird

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:58pm EST
comment that line out

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:57pm EST
#plt.tight_layout(pad=.2,)

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:57pm EST
another hack

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:57pm EST
I found a bug that has a quick fix

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:57pm EST
lol now my graphing script doesn't even run on my computer... this is terrible

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:51pm EST
this is what the first CSE 514 project did to me

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:51pm EST
I wish this wasn't such a time suck

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:51pm EST
lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:51pm EST
god, me too

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:50pm EST
I freaking hate this project lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:49pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
hmm... that's interesting

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
oh really? like a blank sim_IPC

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
0s and null values

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
it just produced bad results

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
is that simple scalar still ran

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
well, the funny thing

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:46pm EST
so we didn't covered some required cases in our validation function then. We just need to fix that function, not so much the extract function

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:45pm EST
pushed

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:44pm EST
I'll commit it as-is for now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:44pm EST
well, we could print out those files that are

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:43pm EST
nah I was asking if you meant that there were files in the results directory that were bad

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:42pm EST
if we wanted

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:42pm EST
yeah, it could

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:42pm EST
do you mean files in the ./results/ directory?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
should it print anything to notify us that there were files with unusable data?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
yea go for it for now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
I wasn't planning to push it since it's so hacky, but I can if you want

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
yea can you push the bug fix

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
but besides that..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
but it looks like ifqsize = 4,8,16 performs way better than 1,2

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
check the results for yourself in case I missed something

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:39pm EST
noope

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:38pm EST
so increasing the ifq size beyond 2 didnt make any differences?

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:38pm EST
haha this project is killing me too.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:37pm EST
it's kind of my moby dick right now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:37pm EST
this project has been keeping me out of class..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:36pm EST
no problem

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:36pm EST
I was in class so sorry I didn't get on top of that

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:36pm EST
yup

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:36pm EST
So it worked for you with the try catch modification?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
regardless of the caches, decode width or fetch speed

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
for a given issue width

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
all of the GMs are the same

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
beyond that, though..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:30pm EST
and they look pretty convincing that we shouldn't set ifqsize to 1 or 2

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:30pm EST
I'm looking over the results that come out of the tests you ran

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:29pm EST
Alright. I'll give that a shot

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
it just avoids those files that provide bad values

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
try: simIPC = float(matchObj.group(1)) except ValueError: continue

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
replace the bad line with..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:27pm EST
I found a hack around it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:27pm EST
okay

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:25pm EST
so, not sure what's going on there

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:25pm EST
then picked another at random that had valid results

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:25pm EST
not sure which one it was, though, I just picked it at random

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:25pm EST
I found one file with bad values

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:25pm EST
I meant the ./results/ex_ifq.../ files

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:24pm EST
That's the problem. I'm not even getting the raw results. Do you mean the rawTable?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:23pm EST
one moment

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:23pm EST
some aren't

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:23pm EST
hmm, some are valid

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:22pm EST
did you look at the raw results?

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:21pm EST
So the extract function didn't give you any problems before or was this something that got introducted not too long ago?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:14pm EST
I looked at one of the results files on a whim, it didn't return any valid results

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:14pm EST
it doesn't return anything - the string it captured is null

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:13pm EST
well, the problem that I'm having doesn't have anyting to do with the config. But what does group() returns for re again?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:12pm EST
gonna look over the configs and I'll let you know if I find anything weird

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:12pm EST
I'm prepping a run with the optimal values for that test

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:12pm EST
I just read over it, tested some values

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:12pm EST
so it ran fine for you?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
er, with the script that generates them

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
I haven't found anything wrong with the configs

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
the results came back with 0s and null values

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
yeah, I just investigated that

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
en431hw6/scripts$ python ex_ifq_speed_decode.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "ex_ifq_speed_decode.py", line 22, in <module> extractDataFromResults(["sim_IPC"], ["ex_ifq_speed_decode"]) File "/mnt/windows/Users/quang/Dropbox/School/Penn State/Fall/CMPEN 431 Comp Arch/cmpen431hw6/scripts/main_script.py", line 220, in extractDataFromResults simIPC = float(matchObj.group(1)) ValueError: could not convert string to float: quang@quang-XPS-13-9343:~/Dropbox/School/Penn State/Fall/CMPEN 431 Comp Arch/cmpen431hw6/scripts$

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
hey did you do any bug fixes on the extract from result function and didn't commit it? cuz I go tthis error when I try to extract the result from the ex_ifq test

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:44pm EST
etc

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:44pm EST
that means mem:width=16, maxed RUU/LSQ

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:44pm EST
I'm going to update the setOptimalVariables method and add a flag that allows you to turn on / off whether you want the optimal variables to be automatically set

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
Huh? What do you mean? The make config method hard set the value?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:40pm EST
I'm going to isolate all variables that we should set for all future experiments to narrow down our options

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:39pm EST
the associativity was hard set

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:39pm EST
disregard the results we have so far

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:39pm EST
of course

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:38pm EST
hold the phone..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:35pm EST
where parameter options battle against each other for dominance

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:35pm EST
I'm kind of imaging this as a sort of "survival of the fittest"

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:35pm EST
that one will probably have to be tested in the final rounds of our testing

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:34pm EST
nothing consistent

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:34pm EST
as for the L1 cache...

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:34pm EST
oh, that's cool - thanks!

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:32pm EST
The only problem is that it doesn't allow you to have more than one project until you pay. but we just need it to examine the data

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:31pm EST
https://plot.ly/~quang319/49/execution-time-ms/

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:31pm EST
also, a good resource for viewing these results is plotly. It allows you to zoom in and out pretty easily. the link below is the graph for functional units test.

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:30pm EST
Did you get any obvious results for the l1 cache?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:30pm EST
I guess you're right

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:30pm EST
oh, yeah

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:30pm EST
whoops

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:29pm EST
I just can't see why the RAS would affect the l2 cache performance

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
like setting the RAS to 8 or 16 instead of baseline 0

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
Alright, should we make the prelimary decision to fix the rest of our tests with l2 cache as direct associative and no bimod bpred

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
I'm worried that maybe some other parameter will change things up

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
like, absolutely dominates

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
because direct mapped blows these numbers away

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
that's kind of what it looks like now

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:27pm EST
Maybe she set the latencies so that students would make the wrong assumptions...

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:27pm EST
direct mapped is the fastest

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:26pm EST
I think it has to do with the latencies

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:26pm EST
This is still weird. I'm still trying to make sense of it.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:24pm EST
already sent that to you

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:24pm EST
whoops

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:24pm EST
static int 1,2,4: dl2 65536 16 1 l static fp 1,2,4: dl2 4096 16 1 l dynamic int 2,4,8: dl2 65536 16 1 l all except comb 8wide: dl2 32768 16 1 l dynamic fp 2,4,8: dl2 4096 16 1 l except comb 2wide: dl2 65536 16 1 l

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:21pm EST
we might be able to drop bimod

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:21pm EST
comb is still performing a lot better

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:21pm EST
I dunno, maybe we need to set the RAS to 16 or something

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:21pm EST
but..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:21pm EST
I'm super confused by it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:21pm EST
that's what I'm thinking

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
the direct mapped is the winner for l2 cache?? how is that possible?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
*way

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
direct mapped is one tway

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
fully assoc would be one set, but a ton of ways

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:19pm EST
But thats directory associative isn't it?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:18pm EST
probably worst around this time of the day

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:18pm EST
yeah, it's ridiculously slow

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:18pm EST
I hate ssh... I takes me forever to get anything done

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:17pm EST
it's always direct mapped, and the block size is 16

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:17pm EST
okay, I'm mistaken - the number of sets is nearly identical in all cases

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:17pm EST
<name>:<nsets>:<bsize>:<assoc>:<repl>

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:16pm EST
let me review the config

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:16pm EST
wait..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
*won

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
in every single case, 16-way one

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
static int 1,2,4: dl2 65536 16 1 l static fp 1,2,4: dl2 4096 16 1 l dynamic int 2,4,8: dl2 65536 16 1 l all except comb 8wide: dl2 32768 16 1 l dynamic fp 2,4,8: dl2 4096 16 1 l except comb 2wide: dl2 65536 16 1 l

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:09pm EST
it's the same across the board for all b-pred types so far

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:09pm EST
our L2 cache might have a really obvious winner

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:09pm EST
uh wow

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
notice that bimod doesn't show up at all

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
gonna look at caches now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
static int 1 comb 2 comb 4 2lev static fp 1 comb 2 comb 4 comb dynamic int 2 comb 4 2lev 8 2lev dynamic fp 2 comb 4 comb 8 comb

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
quick glance at the top winners for each issue width:

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
2lev outperforms bimod mostly, but is pretty close

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
comb seems to have a fairly confident lead

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
glancing over the top ~10 GMs in all pairs

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:48pm EST
I'm eyeballing the top geometric means for dynamic and static for all three branch prediction methods

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:47pm EST
are you just going through these values and glancing at it or are you doing some other comparision?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:46pm EST
gonna compare to bimod now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:46pm EST
it's not as cut and dry as that, as the follow ups seem to interleave values

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:46pm EST
but the winners in all four cases were comb

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:45pm EST
not by much

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:45pm EST
btw, at first glance, comb outperformed 2lev for dynamic and static tests, both integer and floating point

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:45pm EST
same for static 2 and 4

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:45pm EST
when we expect them to outperform

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:45pm EST
because without them, dynamic 4 and 8 wide are being left in the dust

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:44pm EST
though I'm starting to think we'll want to include some of our optimizations soon

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:44pm EST
I think that's valid

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:41pm EST
We can right a test for the TLB in completely isolation right? I can't think of a reason why we would need couple it with anything else

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:34pm EST
the results are still a bit fuzzy, but at least we can start to see how to isolate our variables

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:33pm EST
I know! this is exciting

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:32pm EST
we are making progress!!

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:32pm EST
Thats great!

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:32pm EST
Oh I must be wrong then

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:30pm EST
not sure what the trend is yet, though

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:30pm EST
I think there are some very clear winners

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:30pm EST
btw, I'm just now looking at the results for the BT tests

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
I'm not sure I follow - I did a file count of all of the configs and came up with 360

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
but yea I ran it

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
you gotta cut that in half since it also considers the folder

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
go for it

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
looks like it produces 361

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
alright.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
sweet, that sounds good

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
it only produces 150 or so files so it won't take too long

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:20pm EST
Okay, cool, I'll check it out now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:20pm EST
The commit has it turned off on the master branch, but I switched it on for the tests

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:20pm EST
I uploaded the modified ex_ifq_speed_decode script. I'm about to run it so let me know if you see a problem

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:19pm EST
oh ok.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:18pm EST
I updated the optimal options code to include copying the il1 cache to dl1 so that it matched for every test

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:13pm EST
I just looked at the modification that you to the BT experiments and I see you only only set the il1 cache. That wouldn't be valid cuz dl1 cache must matches il1 cache. Since dl1 is let to be at baseline, you would invalidate all the other options

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:00pm EST
I'll look at it and see what I can come up with

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 3:00pm EST
alright. I committed the bug fix. ex_int_alu_mult_memport is able to run again.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:57pm EST
If you think of a good test, feel free to overwrite it.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:57pm EST
Yeah, I haven't spent a lot of time on it. I started working on it, then realized how many configs it would create.

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:56pm EST
oh dl2lat and il2lat different. the ex_ifq_speed_decode script is failing on l1 cache also though

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:55pm EST
Fix

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:55pm EST
It's pretty simple to gix

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:55pm EST
The L2 validation has a bug in it. I found it again this morning, if you look at the if statements for all associativity greater than 1.

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:54pm EST
Just figured that function out. We got invalid l1 and l2 cache. The thing that worries me is the ex_int_alu_mult_memport is no longer producing results.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:51pm EST
As for ifq, I'm not confident about that script yet.

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:51pm EST
You can debug it by changing the debug boolean at the top of make_configs

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:35pm EST
not even ex_int_alu_mult_memport will run

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:30pm EST
any idea why the script ex_ifq_speed_decode won't run. It won't even make the config files. I run one of the big test script and that works just fine...

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 2:11pm EST
do we still need to run the other ex_BTs yet?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:59pm EST
bbl

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:59pm EST
pushed

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:57pm EST
I'll commit the tables so you can look at the results and produce the graphs

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:56pm EST
let me hold my tongue on that until after I look at this more deeply

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:56pm EST
actually

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:56pm EST
first thing that jumps out - taken and not-taken are off the table

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:56pm EST
taking a first glance at the results for the 6 tests I ran this morning, based heavily on what you wrote last night

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:55pm EST
filled in what I know so far into the doc

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:23pm EST
Ok

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
That sounds good to me! I'll start filling it out soon. I'm running some errands at the moment.

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:15pm EST
This came about because I'm having a hard time of wrapping my head around what needs to be done. I know that I need to analyze some results but I'm not sure which one I need to do

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:08pm EST
Let me know what you think

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
I tried to keep it really simple so hopefully it won't make our process any more complicated

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z-ALktnUdF6VdzY6vCkTMIA2cPbumE-xfZRn9Jjqhyo/edit#gid=0&vpid=A1

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
sorry I was trying to get something together. So I'm not trying to add complications. but I updated the readme file with a link to a spreadsheet. We can use this spreadsheet to keep track of all the tests that needs to be run yet. That way we both don't run the same test by accident. Also it keeps track of whether or not a test has been analyzed

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:01pm EST
I'll push some of the results I've gotten soon

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:57pm EST
mem:width = 16, definitely

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:37pm EST
probably needs to be matched with greater ifqsize and whatnot

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:37pm EST
also, nothing conclusive with fetch:speed in isolation

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:35pm EST
but otherwise, got 5 out of 6 tests finished for the BPred and such

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:35pm EST
looks like one of the computers was restarted

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:34pm EST
wrote up some findings in the drive doc

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:33pm EST
but beyond that..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:33pm EST
and there's never really a case where we'd set both the ALU and Mult to 1

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:33pm EST
I'm pretty confident that we want the memport=2 for dynamic

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:32pm EST
I think we need to mix the tests in with other combinations

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:32pm EST
yeah, it's really up in the air

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:29pm EST
So no conclusive results for the functional units and memport to 2 right?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:06pm EST
memport seems to have minimal effect on static, but seems to affect dynamic integer ALU / multiplier

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:06pm EST
otherwise, the results for dynamic / floating point tests are identical

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:05pm EST
fpalu/fpmult - don't set both to 1, lol. that's the only obvious trend in the data for those

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:00pm EST
Nice! I haven't gotten a chance to pour over any of the data yet

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:55am EST
integer ALU*

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:54am EST
I'm finding a trend that the floating point numbers work best in dynamic for memport = 2, with more than one ALU

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:54am EST
going over the results from the fp / int ALU / multiplier tests from last night

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:51am EST
lol, I've been running the tests on a bunch of open terminal windows

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:51am EST
that's awesome!

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:51am EST
I probably ran a bad command, then

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:49am EST
It worked for me on the first try

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:48am EST
Did you try typing "screen" before killing putty?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:47am EST
but I didn't try to trouble shoot it, so maybe it could still work!

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:46am EST
I tried screen a few days ago actually, and ran into some issues

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1424109

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 11:45am EST
jackpot. This page shows us how we can start a process, close putty, and log back in when the test is finish

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:37am EST
lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:37am EST
as long as no one gets sick of how slow the computers are and turns them off...

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:37am EST
I'm hoping we'll get results for all of them around noon or 1 today

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:36am EST
I'm running another test now on six computers, similar to the ones from last night, except the dl1 cache is now always the same as the il1 cache - this reduced the number of tests to a grand total around 1690

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:34am EST
that's awesome

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 9:34am EST
nice!

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:39am EST
And I figured out the ssh for Windows!!

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 1:31am EST
ok. the problem fixed

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:12am EST
haha np. you too!

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:11am EST
we'll figure out what the issue is - it's probably something about simple scalar we didn't know about

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:11am EST
thanks for working on this for so long

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:11am EST
awesome job, btw

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:11am EST
yea. alright. Have a good night man

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:11am EST
since we'll be able to run all of these on multiple computers with minimal effort

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:10am EST
since we know that none of the tests will take more than 12 hours to run, I'm going to head to bed now

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:10am EST
I think this will require some additional investigation

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:09am EST
it looks that way

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:09am EST
apparently..

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:09am EST
for all of them?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:09am EST
that's the error in the simple scalar output files

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:08am EST
huh? what is that?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:08am EST
at least we know all of the tests will run, lol

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:08am EST
fatal: bad 2-level pred config (<l1size> <l2size> <hist_size> <xor>)

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:08am EST
ah, crap

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:07am EST
oh nice! so they will run for 24 hours now right?

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:06am EST
but on 9 computers, so sets of 2

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:06am EST
no prob! I just started all 18 of them

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:06am EST
sweet! thanks!

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:05am EST
there you are

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:05am EST
Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:05am EST
one moment

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:05am EST
looks like the spaces were needed

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:04am EST
Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:04am EST
try it with space here is the link from the pdf

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:04am EST
I'm not finding it there.. one moment..

Ben HeidornMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:04am EST
haha

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:03am EST
I'm still working on the ssh problem haha

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:03am EST
this is the correct link. https://www.cse.psu.edu/it/documentation/vpn/vpnsoftware/ISPtoCSE.pcf

Quang NguyenMonday, December 7, 2015 at 12:02am EST
is there anyway you can use your ssh to grab this file for me? https://www.cse.psu.edu/it/documentation/vpn/vpnsoftware/ISP

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:46pm EST
She goofed up apparently. She sent out an email saying that issue width 3 didn't work, so we don't have to do it.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:44pm EST
Oh really? Why in the world did she have it in the prompt then?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:44pm EST
Lol, still a lot! But I think it should be workable

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:43pm EST
We could definitely run all of them on different computers. And we won't need to do issue width 3 since simple scalar doesn't support it, so that brings us to 18 tests

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:43pm EST
There are 21 tests.... That's why I said that I wish I could split the load with ya haha

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:42pm EST
Well, the original plan was to have each of the test run on a different computer but if you are going to run them selectively then I was start with the highest issue and work your way down

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:41pm EST
Do you have certain tests I should run, or should we run all of them?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:39pm EST
Woah... Really?? That's awesome!!

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:39pm EST
1/4 the original configs

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:39pm EST
Okay! That looks much better

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:37pm EST
Let's see...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:37pm EST
The configs were made in under a minute for the test I updated

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:36pm EST
No problem! And absolutely, haha

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:36pm EST
Nice!! That's definitely doable. Sorry for the mistake. I guess that's why peer review exists haha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:35pm EST
Which is doable!

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:35pm EST
So.. 12ish hours instead of 46, if my guess is correct

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:35pm EST
It looks like it took each string to be an array

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:34pm EST
Yup

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:33pm EST
Oh the bred should be in the static not the dynamic right?? It just came to me

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:33pm EST
Wait what??

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:32pm EST
Oh wait, I think I found a bug. By fixing this, it should drop the time by three quarters..

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:32pm EST
Like divide the l2 cache into 2 pieces kind of deal?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:30pm EST
Instead of doing it all at once

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:30pm EST
One thing we could do.. is to break up the tests into level 1 and level 2 tests

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:29pm EST
I do, unfortunately. I tried to run the tests through screen, but it doesn't work for some reason.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:29pm EST
That's a hard call. But I guess we can always do other experiments on the side. Do you need to be connected to the VPN at all time?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:27pm EST
Good god... So... Are we gonna go through with it?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:23pm EST
A napkin estimate gives us 46 hours per set of configs

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:21pm EST
Lol, holy crap. 5000 configs per test.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:15pm EST
Crossing my fingers!

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:13pm EST
Haha. Yeah, I feel the same way. I'm really hoping that these tests show some very clear winners, which will make the rest of our project a breeze

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 11:10pm EST
You know, I would have really enjoyed this whole entire project and the path that we heading down if it wasn't for the fact that finals are next week... At this point, it's just a pain in the ass for me haha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:59pm EST
Will do. Thanks! I'll let you know how it goes

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:59pm EST
Alright. I'm gonna head home and work on hw for a different class. let me know if you run into any problems

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:59pm EST
Lol, I hope not! We'll find out. If they do, it'll make a great intro to our paper

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:58pm EST
Or the IT department noticed that you are using up so much resources haha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:58pm EST
But I'd say that's unlikely

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:58pm EST
Hopefully no one restarts a computer

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:57pm EST
Lol, I'm just going to leave a bunch of terminal windows open all night

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:57pm EST
Lol... I just wish that we can divide and conquer on this part...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:57pm EST
Okay, I'll log on and start it up

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:56pm EST
Lol, oh lord

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:55pm EST
"BT" stands for Big Test haha...

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:54pm EST
this scares me cuz it took my computer over 4 minutes to just compute the config files for a single test case...

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:53pm EST
ok its commited

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
Besides, we might get some really good data

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:49pm EST
I don't mind. I'm still awake, and getting them started wouldn't be a big deal

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:48pm EST
actually. nvm... I don't want to make you stay up later than you have too

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:48pm EST
consider that we have 5000 configs... I don't think its going to be done until mid day tomorrow if we start now

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:46pm EST
Want me to run them?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:45pm EST
alright... I'll be done in a the next 5 minutes or so then

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:43pm EST
If it's divided among 5 or more computers, it could be done by the morning

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:43pm EST
Well

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
Probably not

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
267ish configs took about 2.5 hours to run...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
Well let's see

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:42pm EST
Crap

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 10:41pm EST
So... a single test has 5000 configs.... do we still want to go down this route?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:56pm EST
ok

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:48pm EST
Just wanted to give you a heads up about what I saw, to avoid any potential pitfalls

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:48pm EST
Oh, okay. I don't have it open right now, but I probably misread something.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:38pm EST
Since you set both the il2 and dl2 to be the same value, the validation function just assumes that it only needs to check one of the two

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:36pm EST
what bug are you talk about cuz i'm looking at both of the functions and I don't see the differences. I mean, other than the fact that I forgot to multiply it by the # of ways

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:30pm EST
ok

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:28pm EST
Oh, I think the L2 cache validation has a few bugs in it that I cleaned up only in the function to set dependent vars. If you keep the validation, you may need to update the L2 validation to set the latencies for both instruction and data caches to the same value

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:25pm EST
oh i see now

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:22pm EST
Or.. just remove the validation portion if you think we can cover everything by automatically setting the latencies

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:22pm EST
Good catch. I hadn't dug that deep into the cache yet. When you take a look at that, also update the function that automatically sets the cache latency near the bottom

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:21pm EST
I found a bug with the validation function. The cache validation function didn't multiply be the # of ways

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:11pm EST
raw results are pushed

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:11pm EST
I hope the vpn works

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:11pm EST
good luck

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:09pm EST
we'll see

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:09pm EST
not sure if they're useful, since it's fetch speed in isolation

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:09pm EST
sweet

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:09pm EST
gonna commit those raw results as well

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:09pm EST
I just saw that the fetch_speed tests finished

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:08pm EST
text me or message me if you can't get on VPN but want to run some tests

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:08pm EST
sounds good, man

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:08pm EST
Alright sounds good. Well, you should go get some rest then. I'll try to write these scripts

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:08pm EST
agreed

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:08pm EST
yeah

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
except when the associativity is greater than 16, we'll probably see a drop

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
we definitely don't want to do both at this time.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
L will perform better than R in almost all cases

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
and that bring me to the question, don't we just want to use "l" instead of "r" for the big test for the caches?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
last recently used

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
oh

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:07pm EST
it basically keeps track which set was used last, then boots the last recently used

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:06pm EST
LRU - something like least reuse or something

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:06pm EST
oh and r stands for random. what does "l" stands for again?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:06pm EST
I have no idea. I tried to follow some instructions for windows the other day but I wasn't successful then either. Hopefull second time is the charm

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:05pm EST
putty?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:05pm EST
oh, yeah, that should work

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:05pm EST
Nah, I'll write these and then I'm gonna try to switch to windows to see if you can vpn in from there instead

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:05pm EST
don't feel like you have to keep working on anything tonight, but if you commit anything and want to run it, let me know, and I'll get that going

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:04pm EST
sure. That way you can call it a day

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:04pm EST
I'm starting to burn out hard, but if you've got some tests to run in the next hour or two, I'll run them when they're committed

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:04pm EST
if you want, I can run the big tests throughout the day tomorrow

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:01pm EST
I couldn't test the ifqsize in isolation without touching the cache

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 9:01pm EST
running a test on fetch speed now

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:59pm EST
aye

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:59pm EST
oh, if the second para is empty then it grab all the results

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:58pm EST
so you'll need to extract the results from them

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:57pm EST
nothing new, but I only committed the raw results, for example

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:57pm EST
it was a helper function - I was re-running a bunch of tests by recalculating values based on the raw data

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:57pm EST
committed

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:57pm EST
huh... wait what is the function of the extract_from_results?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
and commit that

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
I'll clean up what I did for making the configs easier regarding the cache latencies..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
let me know if you see anything in particular

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
and then the graphing_script.py script

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:54pm EST
you'll need to run python extract_from_results.py (just a wrapper for your function)

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:53pm EST
I just committed the raw results, btw, for fpalu and all that

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:53pm EST
let me commit something I did..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:53pm EST
oh

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:53pm EST
certainly

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:52pm EST
Alright can I go and create these 21 test scripts now? with no other static variables of course

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:52pm EST
awesome, thank you

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:51pm EST
so this is your current https url right? "https://github.com/Cybourgeoisie/cmpen431hw6.git" you are going to change it to "https://username:password@github.com/Cybourgeoisie/cmpen431hw6.git"

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:50pm EST
so I agree with you there

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:50pm EST
yeah, if static single issue won everything, I'd eat my socks

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:49pm EST
Just for 1 test para that we know won't perform well

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:49pm EST
I'm just think of you having to do ssh into 3 different machines for that

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:49pm EST
I haven't actually pushed from the lab computers yet

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:49pm EST
btw, how did you get the git pushes to work?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:48pm EST
I'm just a wary dude - we can eliminate some tests if you're confident that they'll be useless

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:48pm EST
Do you want to test for static 1 at all? I feel like that's work on 3 machine for now reason.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:47pm EST
Alright you know what. Now that I think about it, I agree with you that it is not necessary to make those assumptions at this point.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:46pm EST
lol

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:46pm EST
I'm starting to fade out here

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:46pm EST
er, the ALU / multipliers..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:45pm EST
gonna commit them shortly

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:45pm EST
hey, the floating point and integer tests finished

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:45pm EST
lol

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:45pm EST
we better kick everyone's asses after all this

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:44pm EST
we're gonna end up running some several thousands of tests either way

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:44pm EST
I'm hesitant to make too many assumptions without results to back them up, but..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:44pm EST
definitely the cache / bpred idea

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:44pm EST
I agree with most of the setup you've proposed above

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:43pm EST
lol, it's fair game, I'd say

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:43pm EST
lol nah... that's not our problem

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:43pm EST
I feel bad for the dudes who are using the lab computers that I'm ssh'd into..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:42pm EST
99% of the work is the coding and thinking that we're doing

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:42pm EST
it's no burden - I literally just run it and let it go

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:41pm EST
so what do you think about the setup above?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:41pm EST
darn it... I hate the fact that I putting alot of the burden on you...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:40pm EST
I'm not sure, I've never tried it, but I suspect that you'd need the vpn

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:40pm EST
here is a random question, can ssh into the lab computer from the library computer?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:29pm EST
To speed up the time, we can make the assumption that 2 way for L2 cache won't perform any better than 4,8 and 16

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:24pm EST
Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:24pm EST
And these can be the static variables

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:22pm EST
Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:22pm EST
Alright. What do you think about this structure for the big test tonight. If you think its good and we can agree on all the static variables then I can go ahead and create the script files

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:14pm EST
alright... I would argue that is purely due to mis branch prediction but i guess we can include it

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:14pm EST
dynamic 2 did best, followed by 4 and lastly 8, in the RUU / LSQ test

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:14pm EST
those are the things that I feel like we should have for the test tonight.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:13pm EST
well.. not sure about that yet

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:13pm EST
Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:11pm EST
er, configs

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:11pm EST
they each have nearly 300 tests to run

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:11pm EST
I'll commit those results when they finish

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:11pm EST
I'm still running a more comprehensive test on two of the lab computers

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:10pm EST
it's still all over the map

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:10pm EST
yeah, I've been trying to get decent results

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:10pm EST
nvm... that hasn't been updated

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:10pm EST
Oh i forgot to look at the functional units result with the correct GM. Did you find any connections with that?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:08pm EST
lol

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:08pm EST
I was hoping you'd say that

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:08pm EST
lol

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:08pm EST
thank you

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:08pm EST
Let just write it in code. No need to get fancy att this point

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:06pm EST
or make it more versatile?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:06pm EST
when it comes to "no brainers" that change based on the issue width, should we just add code to automatically set these in the make_config file?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:05pm EST
sweet

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:05pm EST
yes! I glanced over the results and I agree with you

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:05pm EST
for example, if you agree with the RUU / LSQ diagnosis, we should be able to set those to static values permanently

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:04pm EST
I'm pretty sure we can knock out a ton of the excess variables with these smaller tests

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:04pm EST
haha same here

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:04pm EST
We didn't get a result for the ifsize yet but I feel like we can just max that for the big test. Let me know if you think that we are introducing too many variables

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:04pm EST
I'm so eager for this project to end

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:03pm EST
yeah, that's probably valid

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:02pm EST
if we don't get to it, I think we should assume the fetch speed of 4 for the big test

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:02pm EST
since the fetch:speed is represented at "1" and not "1.0" I think that we should just increments of 1

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:02pm EST
for the block size

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:02pm EST
if we can determine the ideal ifqsize, we'll eliminate a lot of excess tests for the cache per this requirement: fetch:ifqsize * 8

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:01pm EST
lol. glad it was useful

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:01pm EST
tried to generate a bunch of invalid configs without realizing it

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:01pm EST
good job on the validation functions, btw

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 8:01pm EST
oh gotcha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:59pm EST
that way, we can set these values as the defaults for the bigger test

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:59pm EST
I'm trying to see if we can isolate any other values with the kind of confidence we're seeing with RUU/LSQ

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:59pm EST
a pre-big-test test

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:58pm EST
is this for the test tonight or for a different test?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:57pm EST
smart. I'm on board with that.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:57pm EST
question.. should we test fetch:speed in increments of 0.5 or 1?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:57pm EST
I just don't think we will get a correct picture of the performance of the caches if we don't at least use some decent form of branch prediction. I was thinking that we can only need to test the default value of each of the branch prediction mode

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:57pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:55pm EST
I don't think that the cache would be very efficient without a proper branch predictor so I think we will need to change the bpred value as well

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:54pm EST
ooh, okay

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:54pm EST
I'm thinking that we should just hit both the l1 and l2 cache in one hit. and just divide up the issue:width between multiple machines.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:53pm EST
so let's talk about how what we want to run for the big test tonight

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:53pm EST
if you mentioned it before, I missed it

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:53pm EST
no problem

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:53pm EST
I'm also going to run one on the ifqsize, decode width, and.. fetch speed

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:53pm EST
sorry

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:52pm EST
I'll handle it

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:52pm EST
it's a very short test

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:52pm EST
lol, no problem

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:51pm EST
oh... I thought you were gonna run that too.... sorry man. Dang... I definitely didn't communication that very clearly

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:51pm EST
I just got the pull now

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:50pm EST
any consensus on the mem:width?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:49pm EST
as for how many ALUs, Mults and memports to use.. those results are not so clear

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:48pm EST
I think we should max out the RUU and LSQ

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:48pm EST
scratch that - those tests won in both floating point and int GMs

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:48pm EST
pretty obvious to see the connection

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:48pm EST
in integer GM

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:48pm EST
dynamic8ruusize64lsqsize32 won for 8-wide

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:47pm EST
dynamic4ruusize32lsqsize16 won for 4-wide

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:47pm EST
dynamic2ruusize16lsqsize8 won for 2-wide

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:47pm EST
sure.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:46pm EST
as for LSQ / RUU - check the results when you get the chance, but this is what I found...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:46pm EST
if you're comfortable talking over IM, it's easier with a traceable record of what we're doing.. because I can be really forgetful if something isn't written down

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:45pm EST
okay. I'm re-running the fp/int ALU/Mult test with memport on two different computers in the lab.. so that should take half of the time as before

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:42pm EST
well, shoot me a call when you get a chance and we can just talk through how we want to break up the big test for tonight. It'll go quicker if we just talk haha (or maybe cuz i'm lazy.... who knows)

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:39pm EST
oh yea go for it

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:35pm EST
I won't do it if you want me to leave them be

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:35pm EST
would you mind if I removed the Validation and testing folders from the table / graph / results folders?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:34pm EST
I also ran some tests on memport / fpalu / fpmult, only for dynamic 8-wide, but I'm not really pleased with them

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:33pm EST
there, pushed the baseline and the RUU/LSQ results

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:31pm EST
that's my suspicion

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:31pm EST
okay, I think that the LSQ / RUU results gives us significant information that we can set those to static values for each issue width

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:30pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:29pm EST
hahah were you refering to the baseline floating point plot that you sent me?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:29pm EST
I'm going to push that up soon.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:29pm EST
hell yeah

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:29pm EST
we got useful data from the RUU / LSQ results

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:28pm EST
oh wait

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:27pm EST
to be expected - the runtime does go up in all cases

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:27pm EST
you can see that the baseline performs best

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:27pm EST
I sent you an image of one of the results from that

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:27pm EST
the only thing that changes is the issue width, in-order and wrongpath

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:27pm EST
I just ran the baseline values

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:27pm EST
it's kind of weird

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:26pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:26pm EST
let me give it some thought.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:26pm EST
I'm kinda getting tired of worrying about what tests to run

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:26pm EST
we might as well

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:26pm EST
lol

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:25pm EST
lol we are going all out here...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:25pm EST
that's one idea..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:25pm EST
oh, we could split it by issue width.. one test, six computers for each issue width..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:25pm EST
but I fear that, even split among multiple computers and running all night, it would still not be finished

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:24pm EST
and just let it run all night

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:24pm EST
I kind of just want to make one really big test

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:23pm EST
haha

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:23pm EST
I will always take up that offer lol

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:23pm EST
we can divide it up if you want me to do more writing, you could create more graphs

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:23pm EST
oh and I noticed what you did with the ruu there. pretty clever!

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:23pm EST
no worries there! I can write really quickly

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:23pm EST
haha don't remind me about the paper. I'm dreading every minute of it haha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:22pm EST
these graphs are going to look really good in the paper

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
No you definitely got a point there.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
besides that, the function is great, though

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:21pm EST
it's also the wrong units - geometric mean is unitless

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
yeah, I hate to sound like a literalist, but that had me scratching my head for a bit

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:20pm EST
Oh its the geometric mean of the execution time. I got you though

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:18pm EST
it says that the execution time drops (y-axis), but that's not the case, as the data being provided is the geometric mean

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
I'll show you

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
one moment

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
as for the graphs

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:17pm EST
I'll fix my scripts to follow that notation

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:16pm EST
certainly

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:16pm EST
Also, in the future, can we prefix our scripts for the experiments with "ex_" or something? that way it stands out and we can group them easily

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:16pm EST
what do you mean?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
I'm going to change that to geometric mean before I commit, if that's alright

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:15pm EST
I noticed in the geometric means graphs, that you're labeling the geometric means as execution times

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
I'll commit a bunch pretty soon

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
ok

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
trying to make sense of them

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
I'm still poring over the results

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
not yet

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:14pm EST
did you push any other test results yet?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
but you might be right

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
I think there's a way to automatically file to have one personally rescheduled

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:08pm EST
you can check on elion in the final exam page, I think

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
Oh really? I don't think I can request for that this late in the game thogh

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
I'm pretty sure it's a school policy

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
because that's ridiculous

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
since you have three finals in a 36 hour period, I think you can ask to defer one

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
I figured

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
the following monday

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:07pm EST
yeah, I've got a final on monday and that tuesday.. actually, we have the same one on tuesday

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:06pm EST
Not tomorrow i meant

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:06pm EST
Yea. I'm gonna give up. I don't feel like wasting any more time on this. I have 2 finals on monday so I'm already tight on time to begin with

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:04pm EST
or several

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:04pm EST
if you have tests you want me to run, let me know - I'm thinking of running a big test over night

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:03pm EST
sorry to hear about that..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:03pm EST
yeah, don't do that

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:03pm EST
oh jesus

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 7:01pm EST
I'm about to give up doing this stupid vpn man. I'm modifying my kernel at this point...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 6:46pm EST
these graphs that your script produce are super helpful

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
Totally plausible

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
Yup, so if we really do want to run 30 tests at once...

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
oh really?? that's awesome!!

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:27pm EST
Which is what I've been doing, lol

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:27pm EST
You can ssh into any of the computers even if someone else is using it

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:26pm EST
the lab is completely packed so you might have a hard time finding an open computr

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:04pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:04pm EST
Alright. I'm probably gonna head to the lab and give this vpn thin one last try then.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:03pm EST
I'm going to migrate back to my house, so I'll be able to run tests for as long as we like

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:03pm EST
if you want, I can run them over ssh if you don't want to enter the lab

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:03pm EST
I'm writing one for the dynamic params - RUU and LSQ

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:02pm EST
perfect

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:01pm EST
I added an experiment for the mem:width

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:00pm EST
sounds good to me

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:00pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:00pm EST
from all the previous outputs, the commit width defaulted to 4

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:00pm EST
I vote that we leave it alone for now. if we have extra time in the end then we can test for it

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:00pm EST
it's a parameter that exists and is supported... I think

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 5:00pm EST
yeah, the documentation doesn't say anything about it

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:59pm EST
I did a search on th e simplescalar documnt but I couldn't find anything... We don't even know what values are valid then...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
do you want to test the commit:width param?

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
It ran slower on my computer for some reaso

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:55pm EST
question for you..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:51pm EST
but really, I think if we got simple scalar to work on our own computers, it would run a lot faster

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:49pm EST
haha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:48pm EST
I had to do something similar for my research, and I was not eager to relive that pain with simple scalar

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:48pm EST
ah, crap, that sucks

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:48pm EST
I spent so much time on setting up the simultor at the begining of the semester too...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:48pm EST
we'd have to copy the binaries directly from the lab machines, which (a) I don't think we have permission to do, and (b) would probably not run on anything that isn't an identical system anyway

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:47pm EST
yeah, that's what kept me from doing it

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:47pm EST
and the raspberry pi idea wouln't work anyway cuz the simultor would give you a different result from what the lab machines will give you. I installed simplescalar on my computer but I can't seem to get my machine to produce the same result for some reason. I made sure that I used benchmarks and everything but the results were still different

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:45pm EST
oops yea. I remember now.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:44pm EST
but not 9 and 7 or anything where the number of ALUs or multipliers are greater than 8

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:44pm EST
so, the most we can do is 8 and 8 for dynamic 8-wide

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
otherwise the experiment will fail

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
which happens to be 8

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
ah, if you recall from the thousand messages I spammed you with, there's a simple scalar inherent limit on what the ALU and multiplier values can be

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
actually it should be (1,16)

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
I have a cluster of raspberry pis, and I really wish I could install simple scalar on all of them to run the simulations in parallel (which is what got me thinking about ssh'ing into a bunch of lab computers at once)

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:43pm EST
for your "alu_mult_memport" experiment, why do you have the range to be (1,9) shouldn't it be (1,17)?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:36pm EST
to only run dynamic, 8-wide

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:36pm EST
makeConfigs("fpalu_fpmult_memport_dyn8", {'res:fpalu': range(1,9), 'res:fpmult': range(1,9), 'res:memport': [1,2]}, {}, {"static": [], "dynamic": [8]} )

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:36pm EST
for example:

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:36pm EST
oh nice. I didn't noticed that until now

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:31pm EST
I added logic to allow us to choose which issue widths to run, so we can restrict the systems we generate tests for

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:30pm EST
one thought - if it becomes painfully obvious that, for example, dynamic 8-wide is going to blow away the remaining systems, we might want to limit our tests to those that we think will "win"

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:30pm EST
{Test Name} can the be the name of our script file. like "alu_mult_memport" for example

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:29pm EST
sounds good to me!

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:28pm EST
So, I'm thinking that we run experiments, get the result, and recording our findings on the google drive document that we made earlier. I can try to go for the follow format

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:26pm EST
nice. Yea I definitely expected some bugs on that one

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:24pm EST
they all look good - I found one or two bugs (and created one by accident) and committed the fixes

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:24pm EST
yup

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:24pm EST
did you get a chance to double check the constraints that I had for the validation function?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:23pm EST
nah, as long as the tests are given different names

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:23pm EST
yea I don't think we will have any conflicts at all with generating the benchmark results

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:22pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
No I haven't tried it yet I'm gonna head over to the lap in alittle bit here and give it another try

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
I'm looking back at the functions right to see there would be any conflicts.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:20pm EST
you mentioned that the VPN is hard to install on linux.. I haven't tried it yet, but if you can get that working, you should be able to ssh into the lab

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:19pm EST
good idea

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:19pm EST
ooh, yeah

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:18pm EST
just have each computer do it own commit message.

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:18pm EST
you can run a test on a computer then commit thaot test result as an individual commit.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:16pm EST
haha, I was wondering how we'd run all of the tests we want..

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
haha I don't have ssh, but that's a briliant idea

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
over ssh

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
and then run them simultaneously on a bunch of the computers in the lab

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
that we can make a bunch of tests

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:15pm EST
I have this kind of evil idea

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:14pm EST
Yea I think we do havei some dependencies with the path

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:11pm EST
I thought about putting the experiments into a subfolder, but we have some dependencies of referring to files / folders relative to the python scripts

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:10pm EST
in ./scripts/

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:10pm EST
if you pull from the repo, you'll see that it's 6 files smaller now

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:10pm EST
I replaced all of the experiment files with one file

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:10pm EST
if you unzipped using the command line, I think the inclusion / exclusion of the forward slash at the end of the folder changes the behavior of the unzip package

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:09pm EST
haha that's weird cuz it as running fine for me earlier. anway, is there anyway that we can generate the script files to run the experiment in a different way? It's so cluttered that I'm having a hard time keeping track of all the experiements that you want to run

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
by unzipping into another directory, it unzipped as a folder containing everything, creating the second level

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
you'll need to rename it

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:06pm EST
yea I unzip that the zipped file that you uploaded.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:06pm EST
when you unzip ialu_imult_test.zip, you'll notice that the folder name is ialu_imult_test_2

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:06pm EST
just a guess - did you unzip into a folder called ./ialu_imult_test/ that you made?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
ah, I get it

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
oh alright.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
*the...

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
*they

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
that's probably a mistake somewhere along he way

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
oh, we shouldn't

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 4:04pm EST
the extractFromResult is not executing. the directory hierarchy got changed. so question, why do we have ./results/ ./ialu_imult_test/ ./ialu_imult_test_2/

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:59pm EST
true.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:54pm EST
ultimately, a ratio is a ratio, and if we use the baseline for this assignment, we'll still get the same best design even if we use a different baseline

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:53pm EST
but not floating point..

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:53pm EST
because we're given absolute numbers that we can use for the integer spec ratio

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:53pm EST
this is a big question, though

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:53pm EST
and the baseline is probably the values of our baseline machine

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:52pm EST
but for homework 5, I realized that there are no floating point SPEC baselines at all

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:52pm EST
I was, too, for a while

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:52pm EST
really?? hmm... I must have been doing my geometric means wrong then

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:50pm EST
actually no. let me take back what I said

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
oh nvm... that is because you multiply by the baseline also.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
we call it the SPEC ratio, but in our case, we our baseline isn't some absolute SPEC benchmark, but just a baseline benchmark of our choosing (or really, of dr. irwin's choosing)

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
the ratio is between the current exec time and the baseline time

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
the geometric mean takes in a ratio, not the absolute execution time

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:47pm EST
another question, why do you divide the product of the execution time by the baesline? I thought geometric means is when you multiply all the results and take the n root? I didn't think you have to perform a divide

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:47pm EST
np

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:45pm EST
I didnt see that part

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:44pm EST
oh gotcha

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:44pm EST
I put it back in the main_script.py so it would be included in the original table files

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:43pm EST
yeah, if you look back a few messages, I moved that logic to earlier in the process

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:43pm EST
Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:43pm EST
because you use the folowing code but you removed the line of code where the function created the execution time column

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:43pm EST
not yet - I made a few changes to it as well, but it looks like they merged safely

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:41pm EST
did you get a chance to test the modified graph_script yet?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:39pm EST
if you have questions or concerns about what I committed, let me know

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:29pm EST
notably, I moved the exec time calculation to earlier in the process so we could view the results in the tables

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:29pm EST
you'll probably want to pull since I touched a lot of files

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:29pm EST
committed

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
and floating for floating

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
the integer ALU / multipliers only mostly affect the integer GMs

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
if you notice from the results

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
alright. I'll take your word it then

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
they can - they're treated separately

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
you tested the interger alu and floating point alu separately. I'm not sure if those 2 things can be isolated like that or not

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
what do you mean?

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
lol, so.. I won't be able to thoroughly vet what I'm committing, but I'm fairly confident about it

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
question, why didn't you just group all the functional units into one test? I feel like they all would affect each other in some way.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
I'm at a cafe, and the wifi is so poor that I can't get the results from the school server

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
ah crap

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:22pm EST
so I'm not sure yet - I think we need to experiment with increasing the out-of-order parameters to see a difference

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
which helps a little bit, but the same general trend appears in the results

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
I found a bug with the geometric mean calc

Quang NguyenSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:21pm EST
so I was trying to make some conclusion out of the results and I couldn't really see a pattern... I mean, I noticed that the best performing machine is when the ialu = 1, but I'm not sure why that is true.

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:13pm EST
I saw your commit - I'm just cleaning up a conflict, then I'm going to push some fixes / updates

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:13pm EST
since the assignment says that the exec time should be reported in microseconds

Ben HeidornSunday, December 6, 2015 at 3:13pm EST
Hey Quang - I'm going to change the execution time units from ms to us

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 6:31pm EST
Oh and I used the config_restrictons.md file for all the restrictions

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 6:22pm EST
Ok ben, I commited the new make_configs file with all the necessary constraints. I gotta leave so I haven't had a chance to double check for any errors though. When you get a chance take a look at the one for "bpred:btb" I had a question on that one

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:47pm EST
Okay, sounds good! I'll probably run one or two random tests tonight and pick it up tomorrow.

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:45pm EST
I'm trying to write down all the constraints right now. I gotta head out in the next 30 minutes so I don't think I will finish it but i'll commit what I have before i leave

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
Assuming we don't crash the computer or someone decides to turn off whatever computer we're connected to.

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
If you think of any tests you want to run, or commit any tests you want me to run, I can ssh into the lab and run them throughout the night.

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:39pm EST
Oh alright. I'll look it up later then

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:35pm EST
I can't remember for certain, but there was a slide that I'm pretty sure clarified it.

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:35pm EST
No, but I think we figured it out, if you review our chat log.

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:24pm EST
* maximum tlb sizes of 256 entries for itlb and 512 entries for dtlb * itlb entries: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256 * dtlb entries: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512 * **Question: Does "entries" mean sets or sets x associativity?**

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 5:24pm EST
did she ever answer this question?

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:36pm EST
I was trying to do that before but the legend of my resulting table keep getting cut off and I couldn't figure out how to expand the size of the plot so that the legend doesn't get cut offf

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:34pm EST
Sounds good to me! If you saw the graph for the integer alu / mult tests, the labels alone covered the entire righthand side, so it'll probably make sense to bring the labels outside of the graph as well.

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:32pm EST
Also, let me throw this idea at you. I was thinking that maybe we should have the graph function output 2 graphs, one for the interter GM and another for the floating point GM. We can then restrict it to show only the top 10 or something. We still have the resulting table to look at if we want to see the rest of the data but at least this way we have a quick way to look though our results. With the way that the script is currently producing the graph, we can't really sense of any of the data

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:26pm EST
Ok. I just checked a couple of the geometric mean results and they came out to be correct. We're safe haha. Alright, I'll add some of the other constraints then

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:09pm EST
Ah yeah, I already added the fp ALU and mult restriction when I added the integer ones.

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:08pm EST
And sounds good! I'll also review the calculation when I get a chance

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:08pm EST
fill in the validation function i meant

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:08pm EST
Fill in the restriction?

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:08pm EST
Also, don't we need to fill in the restriction first?

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
*make sure

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:07pm EST
let me make sure that the geometric means are correct first. I first wrote the function with some mock result files so I wasn't able to verify that everything is 100% correct. I'm gonna do a couple hand calculation really quick to makes ure

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:02pm EST
If you order the geometric means, you'll see that the best performance seemed to have high number of mults, low alus.

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:00pm EST
Btw the results for the integer values was not what I expected at all.

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 4:00pm EST
Let's start thinking up, making and running tests. I ran tests for integer alu / mult and now running them for fp.

Quang NguyenSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:53pm EST
Nice!! So what part can I contribute to at this point?

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:27pm EST
yup, 8: http://lca.ece.utexas.edu/people/jryoo/young/Wattch/wattch-dac/resource.h

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
sorry for the flood of messages

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:26pm EST
not sure what MAX_INSTS_PER_CLASS is set to, but I'm guessing 8

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
if you read through it, or just search for MAX_INSTS_PER_CLASS, you'll see all of the constraints that sim-outorder apparently uses

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/alice/10x10/sst-2.1/sst/elements/genericProc/ssBackEnd/ssb_sim-outorder-options.cc

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:25pm EST
found this file

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the case

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
just sorted the results to see which tests didn't return a geometric mean - I'm guessing that the maximum number of ALUs and multipliers is 8

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
but hey, another constraint

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
not really sure what MAX_INSTS_PER_CLASS is yet

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
"fatal: number of integer mult/div's must be <= MAX_INSTS_PER_CLASS"

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:17pm EST
found a bug with some of the config files, since not all results returned sim_IPC, but if you look at the corresponding configs, you'll see an error message

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:14pm EST
I'm going to commit a few minor bug fixes and the results

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:10pm EST
solid.

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:10pm EST
I was able to zip the results, transfer them locally and then run your graphing script to get the results

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:09pm EST
it took about 20 to 30 minutes to run however many tests those were

Ben HeidornSaturday, December 5, 2015 at 3:09pm EST
Just got all of the ialu / imult configs to run through your runBenchmarksOnTestSets function and got the results from extractDataFromResults, all over ssh

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:47pm EST
Did it work?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:16pm EST
I don't see why not. I tested the main script with python2.6

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:14pm EST
we'll see

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:14pm EST
but I'm kinda curious if I could run all of the experiments this way..

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
I'm about ready to call it a night

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
no worries

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
not the shell

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
at least, in vim

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
so like, the backspace key is printing characters, lol

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
Hmm... Maybe I'll try it again tomorrow. I gave up cuz I already wasted too much time on it haha

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:13pm EST
the problem is that my keyboard isn't properly mapped over ssh..

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:12pm EST
that's what I used, anyway

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:12pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:12pm EST
Wait....do you need that hyphen? I didn't think that was required

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:11pm EST
ssh [username]@lab-218.cse.psu.edu

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:11pm EST
once you're logged into the vpn, then you can ssh using..

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:11pm EST
yeah, I think it's required

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:11pm EST
ahh

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:11pm EST
I was trying to download it on Linux but I was having some problems with it

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:10pm EST
Can't say I'm not jealous right now haha

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:10pm EST
do you have the VPN to log into the penn state cse network?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:10pm EST
I ssh'd in

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 6:10pm EST
welp

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:58pm EST
That's true. Originally, I was only checking the static and dynamic parameters. I think it's safe to remove those checks.

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:54pm EST
Another comment. Don't we already made the assumption that we have included all the variables that we need in our original config file? If that is the case, then we don't really need to check if the variable exists in our settings dict in the validation function right?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:42pm EST
Sweet!

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
Yeah! Definitely. That's a good idea.

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
Let me know what you think. It was just a thought

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:40pm EST
I wish I can ssh into the stupid computer haha. The only changes that I would suggest is to break the validation function even further. The structure that I have in mind is like similar to the mock function below. The reason for this is because I think it will allows us to work on the functions without conflicting each other and it is more descriptive.

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:33pm EST
I just biked home, and while I was biking, it occurred to me that I could call your functions from the same experiment script. I'm gonna see if I can ssh into the lab computer from home. If I can, I'll send you what I used

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:32pm EST
Haha, I was worried I really messed something up

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
oh my bad. I must have overlooked that line by accident.

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
Unless I made a big mistake

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
The static parameters should already be part of the settings before the validation

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:31pm EST
Do you mean the config name construction?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 5:28pm EST
I swear I learn something new whenever I look at someone else's python code. The if/else statement in one line and the dict.update function blew my mind away. Anway, was there any particular reason why you update the setting dict with StaticParams dict after the validation? Wouldn't it make more sense to update it before the validation?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 4:09pm EST
Sure - done at 530?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 4:05pm EST
I have a class at 4 40 also. would you be up for meeting up for a little bit after your 440 class?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 4:04pm EST
I have a class at 440, but I'll skip it to make progress on this lab.

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 4:04pm EST
Haha, stop by whenever if you're still on campus after class. I'm sitting in the same place as before.

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 3:47pm EST
I have an idea on how we should the validation but I don't feel like explaining it through typing haha

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 3:44pm EST
nice!

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 3:43pm EST
Permutation, yes. Validation is just done by eye so far.

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 3:42pm EST
did you figure out the permutation and validation already?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:54pm EST
sweeet

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:51pm EST
Oh hey!! I figure out how to push to github from the lab computer!

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
sounds good

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
*lab

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
Alright. I'll be in late 218

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
I'll be down in about 15 to 30 minutes

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:48pm EST
if you're still in the lab / planning to stick around

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:11pm EST
No not at all I don't have class until 3 30

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:11pm EST
if you have some things you need to do, no worries

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:10pm EST
no, you would only need to use a single baseline file. If you want, I'll stick around in the lab until 3:15 pm. we can just run through everything together if you want

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
if we want to run tests for all 6 combinations of issue widths and static/dynamic, do I need to make 6 different baselines?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:03pm EST
*program

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:02pm EST
If you read through my functions, I make the assumption that if the output file of the benchmarks for the test sets are already there then the problem will not run the benchmarks. So in the worse case, you'll run my test sets one time

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:01pm EST
you also need to make sure that the main_script and run_experiement get the permission to run (chmod +x)

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:00pm EST
is there a way that I can only have it run my own tests and create the config files, or do I need to comment things out in the main_script file?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:00pm EST
alright

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:00pm EST
yea

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:00pm EST
so, it reads a csv?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 1:00pm EST
yea, you need to make sure to export the spreadsheet file to csv though.

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:59pm EST
do I just add a new folder to the csv folder and then run main_script.py?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:58pm EST
can you run me through this process of making tests

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:56pm EST
essentially linux

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:56pm EST
mac

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:55pm EST
no and i'm probably gonna give up trying because I'm keep running into problems with it. Are you sshing into the computer using linux or windows?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:55pm EST
then push from your local computer

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:55pm EST
and just grab everything in a compressed file

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:55pm EST
if you can do that, you can sftp

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:55pm EST
have you been able to ssh into the lab from your computer?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:54pm EST
hmm... there must be a way to push to a remote branch from these computer....

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:54pm EST
unfortunately, no, I haven't done that

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:52pm EST
obviously this is not ideal. Have you have any experiences with using the lab computer and github?

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:52pm EST
No I don't think so. What I ended up doing was just zipping my results up and put it in my dropbox folder, copy the results into the git folder in my personal computer, and pushing it to github

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:50pm EST
does the lab have box?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:50pm EST
ah..

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
I don't think the lab computer has an ssh client installed either so I wasn't able to generate a ssh key...

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
One problem that I see with running these test cases is how are we going to sync it? I tried to push to the remote from the lab computer yesterday but I was having problem with authentication

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:48pm EST
yup

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:48pm EST
yea no that sounds good to me. The structure of our experiements already allow us to do that pretty easily.

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:46pm EST
the purpose of this is that, if we can isolate the best performing designs piece by piece, then we can drastically cut down the number of tests we need to run, while giving us a fairly good shot of running all the tests we need to find the best performing systems

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:45pm EST
does that sound rational, or am I missing something?

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:45pm EST
so it's possible that we could run a bunch of tests on the ALUs and multipliers, and only concerning ourselves with the performance compared to the issue width

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:44pm EST
for example, the ALUs and multipliers should have minimal effect on the performance of branch prediction, TLBs, caches, etc

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:43pm EST
looking over the constraints again, I realize that we can probably test a few of these in relative isolation

Quang NguyenFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:41pm EST
I'm free now. I'm in the lab trying to set up the stupid vpn but I'm not having much luck

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:36pm EST
Let me know whenever you're free, I'd like to bounce a few ideas off you

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:36pm EST
I have some ideas for how we could perform all of the tests

Ben HeidornFriday, December 4, 2015 at 12:36pm EST
Hey Quang

Quang NguyenThursday, December 3, 2015 at 12:51pm EST
If a mobile node travels to a foreign network, will it always receive agent advertisement messages that are marked as foreign? If so, how will the mobile nodes that are considering this network as their home network view these agent advertisement messages that are marked as foreign?

Quang NguyenThursday, December 3, 2015 at 12:48pm EST
but this is an agent advertisement message. Am I wrong in thinking that an agent in a network will most likely be a home agent to some mobile nodes and foreign agent to some other mobile nodes. If that is the case, then what type (home/foreign) should the agent advertise?

Ben HeidornThursday, December 3, 2015 at 12:25pm EST
so, it's not a matter of relative perspective, but both the node and the wireless network agree that the connected agent is foreign

Ben HeidornThursday, December 3, 2015 at 12:24pm EST
when the node travels among different wireless networks, each of which would provide a different IP address to the node, each subsequent network is informed that the node already has an IP address, so from both the perspective of the node and the network, the agent is foreign

Ben HeidornThursday, December 3, 2015 at 12:23pm EST
from my understanding, the home agent is the agent that first provides the IP address to a node - for example, when it first connects with the network

Ben HeidornThursday, December 3, 2015 at 12:22pm EST
Sorry for the late response - I hadn't gotten to that part of the text when you sent it

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:32pm EST
I guess I can't think of a scenario where agent residing in a network would set itself as a foreign agent. I thought whether or not an agent is foreign is determined by the perspective of the mobile node.

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:30pm EST
You said you are working on 514 so let me ask you a quick question. On page 57 of "ch5.pdf" and page 566 of the book, why would the agent advertisement message have a foreign agent bit? the agent (the AP) would always be the home agent to the network that it is residing in right?

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:15pm EST
yup.

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:15pm EST
but it's a nice challenge

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:15pm EST
if we don't get top 5, I'm not going to be real surprised

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:15pm EST
haha

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:14pm EST
woah... alittle ambitious here... alright lets do it then. Yea, i'll put more time into this as I get some of my hws out of the way

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:14pm EST
I'm going to put a lot more time into this project after I get these last two homeworks off my back

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:14pm EST
I'm aiming for top 5, and I think we can do it

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:13pm EST
but I'm pretty confident, too

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:13pm EST
it will be tough

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:13pm EST
haha I can't believe that you just compare her class to the hunger games. That's hilarious!! Well, the good thing is that I have a feeling that we have a good chance of being on the top 10. Probably not the top 5 though

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:12pm EST
the last class she teaches will literally pit students against each other

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:11pm EST
I can see her taking the class down the route of the hunger games

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:11pm EST
exactly

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:11pm EST
she is retiring in a year or 2 so there's no way she'll care what we write

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:11pm EST
otherwise, she's an excellent teacher.. this assignment's grading scheme is just a bit out of left field

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
something I'll bring up on the SRTE, but like she'll care, lol

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
I'm not comfortable with it, since it's unnecessarily competitive

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
seriously

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
yea the points breakdown is rough man. only the top 10 groups will get anything...

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:10pm EST
I think that means we're going to want to run a lot of tests rather than focusing on trying to reason our way around it

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:09pm EST
sooo

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:09pm EST
btw, I saw that prof. irwin is giving points towards the best performing designs in the class overall

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:09pm EST
haha fair enough

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:06pm EST
haha, no worries, I come from a physics background, so literally half of the work was checking units

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:06pm EST
Haha checking units... How in the world did I forget to do that... Amateur haha

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:06pm EST
the execution time equation in hw6 should be correct

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:05pm EST
Yea that's fine. I'm in no rush. I just wanted to make sure that you know of the problem that I was having

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:05pm EST
the units don't match if you use the equation provided in hw5

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:05pm EST
I think that's a mistake

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:05pm EST
lastly, as for the execution time equation in hw5

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:04pm EST
unfortunately, I'm focused on homework for 514 and another class today and tomorrow

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:03pm EST
as for the python script above, I'll take a look at the script when I have some time soon

Ben HeidornWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:02pm EST
I saw - she still didn't really clarify how that affects point #2, but we can probably work around it

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 5:01pm EST
check your angle email if you haven't. She corrected the mistake regarding the ifq

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 1:47pm EST
Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 1:47pm EST
Oh and I wrote the function to produce the execution time graph last night, but I don't know how to fix the problem with the x axis. Ideally, I don't we want our points to be at the very edge of the axis like this. You said that you had previous experience with the matplotlib so maybe you can help me out.

Quang NguyenWednesday, December 2, 2015 at 1:45pm EST
hey ben, help me wrap my head around this. why are the execution time between hw5 and hw6 different? If the equation for hw5 is to measure performance then why don't we use that for hw6 also?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
see you at 514

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:49pm EST
lol, sounds good

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:48pm EST
who does

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:48pm EST
yea. But I literally haven't paid attention in a while

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:48pm EST
that's due on thurs, right?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:48pm EST
haha, sounds good

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:47pm EST
Alright I'm gonna take a break from this for now. I have to do some reading for 514 so I can actually finish the hw haha

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:46pm EST
oh my bad. I changed the authentication

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:46pm EST
sent you a request to edit it

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:44pm EST
https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hCWEWhyZdoGpjgomASmgec-O5ciKBJH06uW5_oFrqo/edit?usp=sharing

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:43pm EST
otherwise, I'll make one and send you the link

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:43pm EST
did you happen to start a drive doc?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:43pm EST
we could also have multiple excel sheets with different baselines

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:42pm EST
it could just be for viewing purposes

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:42pm EST
cleaned it up a bit and committed

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:41pm EST
Would that be just for viewing purposes, because how would our script know which baseline file we are modifying on

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:39pm EST
but we'll probably want to put those in a folder instead of the root directory like I've been doing

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:39pm EST
we could have a config that's like, "barebones static superscalar" or "barebones dynamic" in which we set a few additional requirements and allow the remainder to be modified

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:38pm EST
you know, that's a good idea.. thinking on it more

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:37pm EST
alright

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:36pm EST
but let's make it a separate file

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:36pm EST
we could do that

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:36pm EST
yea I see that. but as we add constrains to the system. it would be nice to have a concise view like this for that too

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:36pm EST
and also defining whether or not a constraint can be changed (IND - independent) or can't be changed / is affected by another constraint (DEP - dependent)

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:36pm EST
but as concise as possible

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:35pm EST
this is literally all of the constraints set forth by the paper

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:35pm EST
no, leave this one alone

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:35pm EST
As we log down our new assumpts and such will we be changing this config_equation_analysis document then or will we be changing another one

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:32pm EST
ok

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:30pm EST
like [0,16] means a range from 0 to 16 inclusive

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:30pm EST
I used some math notation

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:30pm EST
a note on it

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:29pm EST
or, apparently, github's view is good too

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
with monospace font

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
you might want to open it in a code editor

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
it's called config_equation_analysis.cfg

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
committed the new restriction config

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:27pm EST
Thats what I was thinking

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:27pm EST
so we can work on it simultaneously and keep notes

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:26pm EST
drive, definitely

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:25pm EST
So a word document or a good drive document?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:24pm EST
Your current restriction document is good. I think we want to save that so we can refer to it at a later time in the event that we made a wrong assumption

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:24pm EST
since we'll already have our reasons prepared

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:24pm EST
which will be super helpful in writing the final paper

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:24pm EST
we could possibly just have a document that discusses our thoughts for what the values should be, and how they interact with one another

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:24pm EST
that's a good question

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:23pm EST
there's probably minimal gains after a certain number, but I still think we should max them out, since the tests we're running are not indicative of all possible programs that could benefit from multiple ALUs and such

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:23pm EST
so that brings us back to my earlier question. where do you want to store all these constrains that we are adding on top of her constrains

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
neither of which are constraints we're worried about

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
other than physical complexity and cost

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:22pm EST
I can't think of any reason why we'd not want to max them out

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:21pm EST
Are there any reasons why we don't want to just max there 3 parameters at all time?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:20pm EST
that's the output from one of the test. The benchmark interpret it as dec so i'm pretty sure we can use dec

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:19pm EST
Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:19pm EST
tbh, I have no clue how fetch:speed is going to affect our experiments

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:19pm EST
we can assume that it's an integer between 1 and 4

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:19pm EST
I guess we shouldn't overcomplicate things

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:18pm EST
do you know if the fetch:speed ratio is an integer?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:16pm EST
oh nvm. I was looking at the wrong table

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:16pm EST
slide 26 clarifies that

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:15pm EST
no, that would be direct-mapped

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:15pm EST
just for technicality sake, wouldn't a fully-associative tlb be 256/512 sets and 1 entry?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:13pm EST
How do you want to write down these assumptions and reasons that we have? I don't know if you you want us to make all these changes to your config-restrictions file

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:11pm EST
that provides some pretty good info for how we could play with the tlb

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:11pm EST
those two slides

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:10pm EST
Chapter 5C.26 / 5C.27

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:10pm EST
where did you get that from?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:10pm EST
if you get the chance, check out..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:09pm EST
1 set, 256 or 512 entries

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:09pm EST
I think we could experiment with fully-associative in the tlb

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:09pm EST
ooh - this is interesting

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:08pm EST
haha nice!

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:08pm EST
nvm

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:08pm EST
just found a slide in the lecture notes that confirms it

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:08pm EST
yes

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:07pm EST
otherwise, there wouldn't be a constraint on the associativity

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:06pm EST
but not 100%

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:06pm EST
I'm pretty certain it does

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:06pm EST
but does that mean the associativity * num_sets?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:05pm EST
there are maximum sizes of the number of entries

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:05pm EST
*tlb

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:05pm EST
regarding the tld..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:05pm EST
that sounds good to me

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:05pm EST
which is probably not in any of the code we're testing

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
I guess the only way it wouldn't be is if there was code with short time in-between branches

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
I can't think of a senario where taken or nottaken would out perform bimod...

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:04pm EST
I'm not 100% that it's ideal, but there's good reason to suspect that it is

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:03pm EST
umm, we could if you want

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:03pm EST
gotcha

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:03pm EST
for bped, can we put a constraint on it saying that it can only be "bimod", "2leve", or "comb"?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:02pm EST
instead of having to read through the paper and juggle a bunch of different lines

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:02pm EST
the comments are just for us to easily refer to the constraints, one at a time

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:02pm EST
no need for that

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:01pm EST
No thats a lie. I guess I can still add the comments in the spreadsheet

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 1:00pm EST
Alright I'll stick with the spreadsheet method then. The reason I asked is because if we go with the spreadsheet method then we won't have the comments you put in your baseline config file

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:59pm EST
I'm okay with whatever measure you're comfortable with

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:58pm EST
The way my code generate the config files right now is by modifying the baseline specified in the spreadsheet. Do you want me to modify it to make a copy of your baseline config file, changed the name, and modify it instead? The reason why I had it in the spread sheet instead of making a copy of the file is because I wanted a quick and easy reference to the baseline machine as we are entering now parameters

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:54pm EST
with this file, we should ideally be able to make educated decisions as to what systems we want to explore

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:54pm EST
I'll commit shortly

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:54pm EST
almost done

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:54pm EST
I've been taking the config file from yesterday and appending all of the constraints to each individual item as a comment

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:53pm EST
good thinking

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:53pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:53pm EST
I vote that we leave it along for now and we can play with in one of our experiments to make sure that it doesn't affect performance

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:52pm EST
a min bound is susceptible to deadlock

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:52pm EST
that's my guess

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:52pm EST
oh so you're saying its a max bound not a min bound kinda

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:51pm EST
either way, I'm fine with leaving it alone. committing more than 4 instructions at once is probably very rare

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:51pm EST
I thought it was a maximum number of items it could commit at any given time

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:51pm EST
are you sure?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:51pm EST
Looking at the baseline result, it seems like it is independent of the issue width. I feel like we shouldn't mess with it. It doesn't make sense to have it really large because the machine would have to wait until the whole width are ready before it can commit

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
or just make it large..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
maybe we should just ignore it?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
but it shows up in the output files as a config item

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
not in the documentation or any of the homeworks

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:47pm EST
btw, I'm finding nothing about commit:width anywhere

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:47pm EST
aye

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:47pm EST
for il1 and dl1 cache, we are going to need to try both direct mapped and set associative right?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:46pm EST
perfect - good find

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:46pm EST
on section 7.1. they proposed another setup that is better than having a large btb, but I think that design is just having several smaller btbs (which is not an option for us)

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:44pm EST
https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~calder/papers/ISCA-94.pdf

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:44pm EST
I did a search of "btb" in this paper and just read through the sentences that mentioned about the btb, and it seems like having a large btb is ideal

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:41pm EST
sent her an email about wrong path, though I'm pretty certain that it will depend on in-order

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:38pm EST
presumably, the greater the associativity, the more records it can hold at no additional time cost, since the total size isn't restricted, but the number of sets is restricted

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:37pm EST
haha, yeah, I think that's what it is

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:37pm EST
I know I worded that pretty badly haha

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:37pm EST
the btb is the cache that contains the address of whatever the opposite of the branch prediction right

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:35pm EST
I'm not 100% on that, now that I think about it a bit more

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:35pm EST
good thinking

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:35pm EST
yea. Right now I'm trying to look up whether or not we can make your assumption about the max btb

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:34pm EST
or slide

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:33pm EST
but I don't think there was a lecture about it

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:33pm EST
I feel like she briefly discussed this during class

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:31pm EST
lol, I guess I could send her another email..

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:31pm EST
but it would be nice to make it dependent on whether or not we're using in-order

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:30pm EST
I think it's kind of assumed, but I don't know for certain

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:30pm EST
that's my thought

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:30pm EST
We can do the same thing where we can just switch it to true whenever we have a dynamic machine

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:30pm EST
yeah

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:30pm EST
I think that issue:wrongpath is one of the variable that we have to changed. If you look at hw4, she had us changed it to true whenever we switch to a dynamic machine

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:29pm EST
I'm thinking, for wrong path, that if we're using in-order, then wrong path should be false, but otherwise true

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:27pm EST
I think we could assume that, regarding ul2. There are a few other places we could make similar assumptions - like that the btb associativity should probably always be the highest available number (since we're not worried about cost or complexity)

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:26pm EST
Do you know if issue:wrongpath should be true or false definitively? There's no constraint, but from my understanding, doesn't wrongpath = true accurately represent real world systems, for out of order?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 12:24pm EST
can't we reasonably assume that the ul2 cache should never be direct mapped?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:58am EST
Just sent her an email. Hopefully she responds soon.

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:51am EST
Oh gotcha. Let me put some thoughts into that then

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:43am EST
As for the constraints, I think we'll want to define our own and provide reasons for it. I think that's a large part of what she expects in the paper.

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:43am EST
I just stopped by her office, but the door was closed, so I'm going to email her about it

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:37am EST
The reason I asked is becuz I'm heading to campus now and I can see if she is in her office and ask her if you want

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:30am EST
Also, did you emailed her about the ifq?

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:30am EST
What do you mean. All the constraints that you posted were the constraints that were giving to us by the assignment right?

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:26am EST
Though I'm still wondering if we put in enough constraints, whether we'd be able to produce the ideal configs to test.

Ben HeidornTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:25am EST
Haha, yeah, that's why we'll be a bit smarter about it, lol. I did an offhand calculation, and every additional variable roughly doubles the number of possible configs, which is unreasonable, lol.

Quang NguyenTuesday, December 1, 2015 at 11:15am EST
Apparently a friend of mine tried to come up with every single combination and stopped after he generated 4000 config files. Haha

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 4:56pm EST
I would guess so.

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 4:56pm EST
No clue. I haven't found any documentation on it.

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:49pm EST
is the default of the commit:width the same as the issue:width?

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
Alright

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
I'm still going through these restrictions. I'll commit what I write up shortly

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:24pm EST
okay, sounds good! thanks man

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:23pm EST
done! I'm gonna take a break from this for a while.

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:09pm EST
niice

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:08pm EST
alright. N I just finished writing the function to pull the resulting data into a csv. I'll post it in a bit

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:07pm EST
I'm going to finish reviewing the rest of the restrictions to see if anything else doesn't make sense

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:07pm EST
I might do that

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:06pm EST
Or we can email her also

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:06pm EST
hmmm.... I think she has office hours tomorrow.

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:04pm EST
and it's important, because restriction 2 sets a limit on the il1 block size

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:04pm EST
one of them is wrong

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
64/16 is a 4B word size

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
"The il1 block size must match the ifq size (e.g., for the baseline machine the ifqsize is set to 1 word (8B) so the il1 block size is also set to 8B)."

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
restriction 1 says:

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
"ifqsize can be set to a maximum of 16 words (64B)"

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
restriction 5 says:

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
there's an inconsistency in the hw6 documentation

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 3:03pm EST
uuugh

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 2:53pm EST
OK.

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 2:53pm EST
I'm currently assembling all of the restrictions for running tests, and all of the possible config parameters we could use

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 2:52pm EST
that looks good to me

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 2:52pm EST
Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 2:52pm EST
I just realized that the table that i posted didn't include the benchmarks. The table should look like this instead. Let me know what you think

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:54pm EST
Sweet!

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:53pm EST
it'll make it really easy to make graphs and translate into latex tables

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:53pm EST
that looks solid to me

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:33pm EST
Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:33pm EST
Now for the 3rd task (parsing the results and getting the data that we want), what kind of format do you want to work with? Are you ok if we produce a csv that represents the table below?

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:28pm EST
sweet - I saw. sounds good!

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:18pm EST
I just added the spreadsheet that we can use for our test cases under the csv file. I just added the 2 testcases so thatI can test my function. We can delete it then

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:08pm EST
gotcha

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:07pm EST
which is a github setting - you should have full access now

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:07pm EST
haha, I didn't know I had to add you as a collaborator to the project

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:06pm EST
oh hey! it works. what was the problem?

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:03pm EST
try now

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:02pm EST
one moment..

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 1:02pm EST
oh, oh

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:59pm EST
okay

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:59pm EST
give me a sec. let me do some more googling

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:59pm EST
hmm

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:58pm EST
yea

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:58pm EST
did you clone it with git clone [repo address]?

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:58pm EST
yea I did the pull, made my changes, add and commit my changes. Now I am trying to push it back to you and I'm getting a 403 error. I think this might be because of ssh

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:58pm EST
git pull is like svn update - it will update your local repo to the HEAD of the master repo (or whatever branch you're on)

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:57pm EST
to move it to github

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:57pm EST
then git push origin master

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:57pm EST
then git commit to commit

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:57pm EST
you can review what you're committing with: git status

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:57pm EST
add the file: git add [file or folder]

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:56pm EST
make the file

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:56pm EST
the order of ops is..

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:56pm EST
as a push

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:50pm EST
I'm having a hard time getting my changes up to the repo. I should commit my changes as a pull request right?

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 12:49pm EST
darn it. I finished but o

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:24am EST
in a bit, I'll commit a stub that we can use

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:23am EST
sweet. It's really simple, just a bit tedious at times

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:23am EST
That what I was thinking too. I haven't done it before, but I'm interested in learning it

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:21am EST
if you haven't done so before, I think it would be a good experience (plus, if you make your resume in latex, it looks really good to prospective employers)

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:21am EST
are you interested in working in latex for the paper?

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:16am EST
haha, awesome! sounds good

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:14am EST
I will have the csv parser function up on the repo before 12

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:10am EST
okay

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:10am EST
alright I'll place it under the "./csv/" directory then.

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:08am EST
I left the project layout incomplete so we could change it as needed, lol

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:07am EST
wherever works for you

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:07am EST
Where in the dir should we place the csv file?

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:07am EST
I'm good with however you'd like to do it, honestly

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:06am EST
no not at all. I guess I didn't noticed that suggestion in the hw2. Making it a absolute directory is a good idea

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:05am EST
if it makes it easier, we can do that, but I don't mind moving my folders around to match your layout

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:05am EST
if you're referring to the change directory command in the run_experiments.sh file, we can change that as needed - including just passing in a number or name and choosing the correct paths

Ben HeidornMonday, November 30, 2015 at 11:03am EST
I think our benchmarks should be in the same absolute directories, as it was part of the original assignment (HW2 / the evening class) to copy the simple scalar benchmarks to a specific location within our home directories

Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 10:55am EST
Quang NguyenMonday, November 30, 2015 at 10:55am EST
Hey, I just looked over the readme file and it looks really good. I can do the 1st and 3rd tasks if you want. The only problem that I think we might have is our directory path. You and I will have different paths to our benchmarks folder. Do you want something where the python script would require us to input our name or a number for user's identification?

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:59pm EST
for now, I think I will stick with the theory that the machine doesn't peform a wakeup until the wb stage. I will make a note to ask the prof next week.

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:58pm EST
that kind of mathces up with what page 63 of the ppt said.

Ben HeidornSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:57pm EST
Sorry, load, not store.

Ben HeidornSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:57pm EST
But.. I suspect you might be right, and the store might perform the IQ lookup as soon as it finishes.. or else the wakeup might not happen until the next cycle

Ben HeidornSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:55pm EST
I think the load and store instructions do participate in the wakeup (not certain, we should probably ask the prof) but that the loads and stores don't flip the ready bit in the Ready Table until the load completes execution.

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:53pm EST
So basically, the wakeup step of the issue stage does not apply to load and store instructions at all. Only the rest of the other instructions use the wakeup function

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:52pm EST
yea I think I agree with you that the instruction is just there as a reminder and that it should be removed. so this is the steps that i think the lw instruction took. Let me if you think it is right. 1. The lw was marked ready and was sent for execution 2. Once the lw was done, the wb stage of the pipeline, perform an associated search on the IQ and wakeup the instructions that has the right src address

Ben HeidornSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:46pm EST
I'm not 100%, but I think that the load instruction was issued, but our professor might have just left the instruction in the IQ in faded font as a visual aid to remind us to flip the ready bit for p4 when the load completes.

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:43pm EST
Also, I don't know what your plan is but i'm planning to spend the rest of the day studying for this stuff. Idk if you want to study together or not.

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
When an instruction is flagged as ready, it will be executed and removed from the IQ right?

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:41pm EST
I thought the IQ can only support the ready flag? How can it flag a instruction as issued?

Ben HeidornSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:33pm EST
Oh, I think that just because the select and wakeup occur at the same time, doesn't imply that the wakeup will mark all source registers as ready - I think the wakeup procedure takes into account more than just whether an instruction with the appropriate destination register is issued. That would fit with the load scenario.

Ben HeidornSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:29pm EST
If you look at slide 63 from 4F, it states that a load from memory will update the ready table once the load completes. I think this is an exception to the select and wakeup procedure, but I can't find an exact reason that explains it (other than that it makes sense to wait to mark source registers as ready until the data is available)

Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:21pm EST
Quang NguyenSaturday, November 14, 2015 at 5:21pm EST
Hey Ben, I don't know how familiar you are with OOO for 431, but I have a quick question for ya. My question is on the issue stage of the OOO pipeline. the ppt said that the select and wakeup process happens all in one cycle. If that is the case, then why didn't p4 of the circled "addu" instruction not get set to ready? Should the machine performed an associated search for p4 when the lw instruction before it got issued and turn the ready bit to yes?
